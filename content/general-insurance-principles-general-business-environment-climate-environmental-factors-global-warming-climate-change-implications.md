As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, the implications of **Global Warming / Climate Change** constitute a major and evolving source of **Climate & Environmental Factors** uncertainty that must be integrated into modern pricing and capital modeling. Climate change introduces systemic risks across physical, transition, and liability categories, challenging the relevance of traditional actuarial data.

## **I. Defining Climate Change Risk and Uncertainty**

Climate change refers to **long-term changes in average weather patterns**, which scientific consensus has linked to the **rise in average global temperatures** due to human activity associated with greenhouse gas emissions.

1. **Uncertainty and Data Obsolescence:** Climate change is expected to be an increasing source of **risk and uncertainty** for insurers. Crucially, it causes historical occurrence patterns for weather-related claims to **no longer be appropriate**. Actuaries must reassess the extent to which they can rely on historical experience. For example, using 30 years of past event data to calibrate a model may mean that it reflects a climate approximately 15 years out of date.  
2. **Increased Volatility:** Experts suggest that even small changes in climate can have a **more than proportional effect** on insurance losses, although this is impossible to prove. It is also argued that global warming will increase the **volatility/unpredictability** of weather-related claims, even if the mean expected loss does not immediately change.  
3. **Quantification Challenge:** Quantifying the rate of climate change is a **difficult challenge and open to debate**. Insurers face the problem of not being sure if long-term trends exist, or where they will lead.

## **II. Physical Risks and Claim Cost Implications**

Climate change directly impacts physical risks by altering the frequency and severity of catastrophic events.

1. **Increased Extreme Events:** Climate change is expected to result in **increased intensity and frequency** of extreme weather events. These include heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, flooding, and tropical cyclones (hurricanes/typhoons).  
2. **Hurricane Severity:** Warmer seas are expected to lead to **larger, more powerful hurricanes**.  
3. **Coastal Damage:** Higher sea levels lead to **larger, more dangerous storm surges**. As sea level rises and flood risk increases, some coastal areas may become **uninsurable**, and existing infrastructure built without sufficient consideration for resilience may become more expensive to insure.  
4. **Regional Variation:** Climate effects are expected to vary regionally, with either increased or decreased correlations between regional perils. For instance, areas like Bangladesh are expected to experience more rain, while the South-Western US is expected to experience more droughts.

## **III. Transition Risks**

Beyond direct physical damage, insurers are exposed to **transition risks** associated with society's shift toward a low-carbon economy.

1. **Asset and Investment Risk:** Government policies aimed at reducing global warming might reduce the **value of assets held by an insurer**, such as holdings in fossil fuel companies. Insurers also face pressure to **withdraw insurance support** from companies in the fossil fuel sector, such as coal producers.  
2. **Underwriting and Product Risk:** This transition may lead to a change in risk profiles and the emergence of new risk types. Examples include:  
   * Changes in commercial risks due to the adoption of more **sustainable manufacturing processes**.  
   * Increased **product liability risks** stemming from new technologies, such as high energy storage batteries which have a high risk of overheating and explosion.  
   * Changes in motor liability risks due to the replacement of fossil fuels with **renewable energy sources**.

## **IV. Liability Risks**

Liability risks are those associated with **compensation claims** for losses due to physical or transition risks.

1. **Litigation:** Litigation may emerge against existing policyholders (e.g., corporate directors) for **failure to mitigate, adapt, and disclose** climate risks they faced.  
2. **D\&O Claims:** This could lead to increased losses in **Directors’ and Officers’ (D\&O) insurance** due to claims against companies for failing to consider climate change in their strategy.

## **V. Strategic and Financial Management Implications**

Climate change significantly complicates risk aggregation, capital allocation, and market operations.

1. **Dependencies and Correlation:** Climate risk may introduce **dependencies or 'ripple effects'** across different risk types, regions, or business classes.

   * A flood event can trigger **business continuity and supply chain risks**, further increasing uncertainty.  
   * An increase in sea level may cause mass migration and changes in economic activity levels, which have consequences for the availability and performance of investment assets, leading to added dependency between **insurance risk and market risk**.  
   * Increased frequency and severity of flood events could be a common driver worsening claims experience in classes like trade credit insurance and household insurance simultaneously, where correlation was not previously expected.  
2. **Pricing and Underwriting Response:** Since general insurance is primarily an annual contract, companies can **adapt gradually** to changes. Short-term measures include:

   * Increasing premiums (overall or for certain risks).  
   * Excluding specific perils or changing benefits.  
   * Strengthening underwriting controls or revising the target market (e.g., stopping marketing activities in certain locations).  
3. **Reinsurance Market Impact:** Reinsurance availability is likely to change, with reinsurers potentially **increasing their rates and placing caps on exposures** from particular perils or regions. If an insurer relies on reinsurance for accumulation risks, this may **diminish the insurer’s underwriting capacity**.

4. **Political Difficulties:** If insurers fully reflect the true location-based risk (e.g., flood damage) in their premiums, it can cause **political difficulties**, potentially leading to certain properties becoming uninsurable against specific perils. Governments often respond by intervening, sometimes leading to pooling arrangements, such as **Flood Re in the UK**, which is financed by a levy on all insurers.
