### **1\. Heavy Dependence on the Prior Estimate (Subjectivity of Initial Assumptions)**

The most significant disadvantage of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method stems from its core reliance on an **initial expected ultimate claim amount** or **prior estimate**.

* **Subjectivity and Influence**: This prior estimate can be highly subjective, often derived from "soft information" such as the underwriter's opinion, or previous year's best estimate results adjusted for various factors. As a result, the ultimate reserve "can be heavily dependent on this prior estimate," particularly in the early stages of a cohort's development.  
* **Difficulty in Gathering Information**: Gathering the necessary "information for the prior estimate for the claims" can be challenging. This practical difficulty can undermine the reliability of the method if the initial assumption is not robust.  
* **Sensitivity to Inappropriate Priors**: If the "assumed run-off pattern or ultimate loss ratios are inappropriate," the entire "Bornhuetter-Ferguson method" can be invalidated. The method's outcome can even appear counter-intuitive if the prior estimate conflicts significantly with emerging experience, even if that experience is immature. For instance, a chosen independent estimate might lead to a BF result higher than a basic chain ladder, or an initial estimate could be outside the expected range given other methods. A "suitable a priori estimate of losses" is a prerequisite for the method's statistical superiority.

### **2\. Decreasing Suitability and Limited Use for Mature Data**

While the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method excels when claims data is "at a very early stage of development", its utility diminishes as a cohort matures.

* **Preference for Other Methods at Maturity**: It is generally considered "unusual to use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method after the first few development years, once the data is reasonably well developed". For "longer durations" or "more developed origin periods," a "chain ladder or case estimate approach would be preferred" or given "more weight".  
* **Reduced Effectiveness**: The method is "most effective when the current data is too immature to be developed on a projection method", implying it is less effective once sufficient credible data has emerged to support a pure projection.

### **3\. Challenges with Negative Incremental Claims/Development**

Certain data characteristics can pose problems for the standard application of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, especially when dealing with incurred claims data.

* **Impact of Negative Tails**: If the data being projected "may develop with a negative tail," or if "incurred development displays a negative tail," the "assumed percentage developed" might become "unsuitable as a weight in this credibility method". This necessitates adjustments, such as selecting "different weights" or shifting the application to "paid development".  
* **Limitations of Bayesian Form**: Specifically, the Bayesian form of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson model "cannot handle negative values", which is a significant constraint when incurred claims data frequently exhibit negative incremental movements due to large recoveries or changes in case estimates.

### **4\. Practical Complexity in Advanced Implementations**

While not a direct disadvantage of the fundamental deterministic BF method, its more advanced, stochastic forms (such as the Bayesian Bornhuetter-Ferguson model) introduce complexities that can be challenging in practice.

* **Parameterisation of Correlations**: In a Bayesian framework, questions arise regarding how to "allow for correlations" between development factors and the "initial expected ultimates," particularly if these initial loss ratios are derived from trended triangle estimates of earlier origin years. This indicates that moving to a full stochastic implementation of the BF method requires careful and often complex parameterisation of dependencies.  
* **Infrequent Use of Iterated Variants**: The Benktander method, which is also known as the Iterated Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, is "not very commonly used". While not explicitly stated as a disadvantage *of BF itself*, this observation about a related, more complex variant might imply practical difficulties in its implementation, possibly due to increased complexity without a perceived commensurate increase in practical benefit.

In summary, while the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is an invaluable tool for reserving, especially in situations with limited or immature data, its reliance on a judiciously chosen prior estimate, its diminishing returns for mature cohorts, and potential issues with negative claims development are critical considerations. For your SP7 examinations, a thorough understanding of these disadvantages, coupled with the ability to articulate when other methods might be more appropriate or what adjustments might be needed, will demonstrate a comprehensive grasp of reserving principles.
