As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note on **Retrocession**, placing it within the broader framework of Reinsurance. Understanding this "reinsurance of reinsurance" is a key concept that demonstrates a deeper knowledge of how risk is spread throughout the global insurance market.

### **Reinsurance: The Insurance of Insurance Companies**

#### **ðŸ”¸ Definition and Core Concept of Retrocession**

Retrocession is a specific form of reinsurance purchased by a reinsurance company. In simple terms, it is the **reinsurance of reinsurance**. This transaction creates a chain of risk transfer where the party ceding the risk is a reinsurer, and the party accepting it is another reinsurer.

The terminology follows the same pattern as primary reinsurance:

* **Retrocedant**: The ceding reinsurer in a retrocession agreement.  
* **Retrocessionnaire**: The assuming reinsurer that provides the retrocession cover.

Essentially, when a reinsurer accepts a substantial amount of reinsurance business, it may require its own reinsurance protection to manage its portfolio, and this protection is called retrocession.

#### **ðŸ”¸ Why Reinsurers Purchase Retrocession**

While reinsurers purchase retrocession for many of the same general reasons that a primary insurer purchases reinsurance (such as limiting exposure and increasing capacity), the emphasis is slightly different, reflecting their unique position in the market. The sources highlight two principal reasons:

1. **Limitation of Exposure to Risk**: A reinsurer may find itself heavily exposed to specific geographical regions (like Florida windstorm risk) or particular classes of business (like aviation liability). Retrocession allows the reinsurer to contain or reduce its risk of loss on either a specific or an aggregate basis, thereby protecting its own portfolio from excessive volatility or catastrophic events.

2. **Increasing Underwriting Capacity**: Retrocession allows a reinsurer (the retrocedant) to gain additional capacity. By ceding a portion of its risk, the reinsurer reduces its net liabilities and the capital required to support them. This freed-up capital can then be used to accept more reinsurance business from primary insurers.

*Exam Coach Tip: Notice that while financial assistance and access to expertise are key reasons for a primary insurer to buy reinsurance, they are less critical for a reinsurer buying retrocession. Reinsurers are typically large, specialist firms with significant in-house expertise and financial resources, so these drivers are less common.*

#### **ðŸ”¸ Common Forms and Characteristics of Retrocession**

* **Basis of Cover**: Typically, retrocession protections are written on an **excess of loss (XL) basis**. This is because reinsurers are often looking to protect themselves against large or catastrophic events rather than seeking proportional relief on every risk.  
* **Types of Business Covered**: A retrocession can be structured to protect a reinsurer's portfolio of facultative, proportional, or excess of loss business, or a combination of all three.

#### **ðŸ”¸ The LMX Spiral: A Key Risk Associated with Retrocession**

A significant risk that can arise from retrocession is the **LMX (London Market Excess of Loss) spiral**. This phenomenon occurs when reinsurers write retrocession business on risks to which they already have exposure through other reinsurance agreements.

* **Mechanism**: A chain of retrocession agreements can lead to the original retrocedant (the first reinsurer in the chain) unintentionally reinsuring itself. This happens because the risk is passed around the market, often with inadequate information, until it spirals back to an earlier participant in the chain.  
* **Consequence**: When a major loss event occurs, a reinsurer might discover that its retrocession protection is much less effective than imagined because it is, in effect, paying itself for its own losses. This concentration of risk, rather than spreading it, was a major factor in the enormous losses seen at Lloyd's in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

*Exam Coach Tip: The LMX spiral is a classic, highly examinable example of the dangers of inadequate data and risk aggregation in reinsurance. When discussing retrocession, mentioning the spiral demonstrates a strong historical and commercial understanding of the risks involved. It highlights the critical need for reinsurers to have detailed information about the underlying risks they are assuming to avoid unknowingly concentrating their exposures.*
