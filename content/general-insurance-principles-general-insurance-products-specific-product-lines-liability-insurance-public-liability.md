As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a comprehensive note on **Public Liability (PL) Insurance**, placing it within the larger context of **Liability Insurance**. This is a fundamental product line, often appearing in exam questions as part of a package policy or as a standalone commercial risk.

### **Specific Product Lines: Liability Insurance**

#### **ðŸ”¸ Public Liability (PL)**

Public Liability (PL) insurance is a core type of liability cover designed to indemnify the insured against their legal liability to pay compensation to a third party for death, bodily injury, or damage to their property. It is a specific form of liability insurance that covers incidents not already addressed by more specialised liability policies like Employers' Liability or Motor Third Party Liability.

##### **1\. Customer Need and Benefits**

The primary need met by PL insurance is to protect individuals and businesses from potentially large financial losses arising from legal claims made by members of the public. These claims typically stem from a tort, such as negligence, where the insured is found to be at fault for an incident causing harm or damage.

The benefits provided under a PL policy are primarily an indemnity against the financial loss. This includes:

* **Compensation Payments**: Covering awards for death, bodily injury, or property damage to third parties.  
* **Legal Expenses**: The policy will almost always cover the legal costs associated with defending a claim.

Unlike Employers' Liability and Motor Third Party Liability, which are often compulsory by law, there is generally no legal requirement in the UK for individuals or businesses to hold Public Liability insurance. However, for certain specific institutions, such as horse-riding establishments and nuclear installations in the UK, it is a statutory requirement. It is frequently sold as a key component of "package policies" for both businesses (like small retailers) and households.

##### **2\. Insured Perils and Scope of Cover**

The range of insured perils under a PL policy is broad, as it is designed to be a general catch-all for liability to the public. Policies will not typically restrict cover to a list of named perils, although specific exclusions may apply.

The scope of cover can be broken down into two main types:

1. **Risk at the Insured's Premises**: This covers incidents occurring at the insured's own commercial premises, such as a warehouse, office, or shop. For example, a customer slipping on a wet floor in a shop would fall under this cover.  
2. **Risk Away from the Insured's Premises**: This covers incidents that happen while the insured is carrying out work away from their main location. A classic example would be a building contractor who causes injury to a member of the public due to a falling object at a construction site.

Household policies also commonly include public liability cover, protecting the homeowner against claims for personal liability arising from their property, such as a garden wall falling on a pedestrian.

##### **3\. Claim Characteristics**

Public Liability is a **long-tail** class of business, sharing many characteristics with other liability lines like Employers' Liability.

* **Delays**: Significant reporting and settlement delays are a key feature. Claims involving bodily injury can take many years to settle, as it takes time for the victim's condition to stabilise and for legal liability to be established, sometimes through lengthy court proceedings.  
* **Basis of Cover**: The basis for cover is likely to be on a **losses-occurring basis**, meaning the policy in force at the time of the incident is liable, regardless of when the claim is reported.  
* **Claim Frequency and Severity**: Claim frequency tends to be low, but the claim cost distribution is widely spread with the potential for very large claims, especially those involving serious bodily injury.

##### **4\. Pricing and Underwriting**

##### **ðŸ”¸ 4.1 Measure of Exposure**

The most commonly used measure of exposure for pricing Public Liability insurance is the insured's **turnover**. An alternative that is sometimes used as a proxy is **payroll**, based on the rationale that a larger workforce often correlates with greater public liability risk (e.g., more employees interacting with the public or working off-site).

##### **ðŸ”¸ 4.2 Risk and Rating Factors**

As a commercial risk, each PL policy is typically underwritten individually, with the underwriter assessing the specific risks presented by the client. Key underwriting factors include:

* **Nature of the Business**: The type of industry or occupation is a primary risk factor. A construction company presents a very different risk profile to a retail shop.  
* **Location**: The physical location of the business and its operations.  
* **Claims History**: The company's past claims experience.  
* **Frequency of Visitors**: How often members of the public visit the insured's premises.

*Exam Coach Tip: In an SP8 exam, if you are asked to discuss a package policy for a small business, you must identify Public Liability as a core component. When discussing its pricing and risks, immediately classify it as a **long-tail liability** line. This allows you to discuss the associated challenges: high uncertainty in reserving and pricing, the significant impact of claims inflation and discounting over the long settlement period, and the use of **turnover** as the primary exposure measure. For a household policy question, remembering to mention the included PL cover (e.g., for visitors' property or injury to the public) adds valuable depth to your answer.*
