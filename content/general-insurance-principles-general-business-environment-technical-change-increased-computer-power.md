Based on the provided sources and our previous conversation, here is a detailed discussion of increased computer power in the larger context of technological change.

### **The Context: Technological Change as a Driver of Efficiency**

The sources establish that technological change is a significant component of the general business environment, profoundly impacting general insurers. It is an accelerating force that brings increasing efficiencies to both insurers and their customers. This evolution has reshaped insurers' operations in sales, marketing, and, most significantly, in their analytical and modelling capabilities. A primary catalyst for these advancements has been the dramatic increase in computer power.

### **The Impact of Increased Computer power**

The availability of greater computing power, coupled with the reduced cost of data storage, has enabled insurers to perform much more complex analysis on vast quantities of data. This has fundamentally transformed pricing and risk assessment.

Key developments directly enabled by increased computer power include:

* **Complex Modelling:** Insurers can now process and analyse extremely large and detailed datasets, allowing for the creation of more sophisticated and accurate predictive models. The ability to handle vast quantities of data is a direct result of this increased capacity.  
* **Generalised Linear Models (GLMs):** The use of GLMs for pricing personal lines and small commercial risks is now widespread, a development made possible by the increase in computing power. GLMs are a form of supervised machine learning that allows actuaries to model the impact of multiple rating factors simultaneously, leading to more accurate and equitable premiums.  
* **Advanced Machine Learning:** Beyond GLMs, greater computer power has facilitated the use of other, more complex machine learning techniques such as Gradient Boosted Models (GBMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (deep learning).  
* **Sophisticated Software:** The market for advanced modelling software, including machine learning tools and natural catastrophe models, has grown significantly, supported by the underlying increase in computer capacity. This software allows for more accurate predictive modelling and strategic forecasting.  
* **Reduced Need for Data Pre-processing:** In the past, actuaries had to group and summarise input data before loading it into modelling software due to system limitations. With modern computing power, it is now possible to retain much more granularity in the data, allowing the patterns within the data itself to define the appropriate groupings and smoothing, leading to more accurate models.

In essence, increased computer power is the foundational technological shift that has unlocked the advanced analytical techniques now central to modern general insurance pricing and capital modelling. It has moved the industry from simpler, univariate analysis to complex, multivariate modelling, enabling a more precise and data-driven approach to risk management.
