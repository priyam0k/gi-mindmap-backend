The **Underwriting Cycle** is an essential economic factor that dictates the overall profitability and market dynamics within the general insurance sector. It is characterized by a systematic oscillation of premium rates and profitability, moving between periods known as hard and soft markets.

As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, I highlight the direct and inverse relationship between the movement of premium rates/volumes and the resulting loss ratios during the cycle's progression.

## **I. Impact of the Hard Market Phase**

The hard market refers to periods where premium rates are high and the business written is typically profitable.

### **1\. Premium Rates and Pricing**

* **High Rates:** Premiums are generally high (or "hard").  
* **Profit Allowance:** Insurers can make a **large allowance for profit** in their premiums. Rates may intentionally be set higher than strictly required to cover technical risks due to reduced competition.  
* **Terms and Conditions:** Policy terms and conditions tend to be **more stringent**, with deductibles potentially being added or policies attaching at a higher level.

### **2\. Premium Volumes and Competition**

* **Capacity Expansion:** The high level of profits attracts new entrants to the market and encourages existing insurers to **write more business**. Companies typically respond by trying to **expand their market share**.  
* **Capacity Increase Trigger:** This increase in capacity (supply) puts pressure on rates to fall, initiating the movement towards the soft market.

### **3\. Loss Ratios and Profitability**

* **Low Loss Ratios:** During the hard market, the high premiums result in low loss ratios, meaning the business is **highly profitable**.  
* **Reserving Practices:** An insurer may be **less prudent in claims estimation and reserving** during this phase if they believe the current business is more profitable than it truly is. Conversely, this over-estimation of reserves during a hard market can delay the recognition of losses when the market subsequently softens.

## **II. Impact of the Soft Market Phase**

The soft market represents the trough of the cycle, characterized by intense competition and low profitability.

### **1\. Premium Rates and Pricing**

* **Low Rates:** Premium rates fall to low levels (or "soft").  
* **Profit Allowance:** Insurers need to make a **much smaller allowance for profit** (if any) in their premiums. Rates may even fall to the extent that the business becomes loss-making.  
* **Terms and Conditions:** Policy terms and conditions tend to be **less stringent**. Insurers may gradually reintroduce optional (and often expensive) parts of the cover that were removed during the hard market.  
* **Maintaining Volume:** Insurers may deliberately price aggressively (deviating from actuarial indications) to maintain market share or secure a minimum volume of business to support fixed overhead costs.

### **2\. Premium Volumes and Capacity Reduction**

* **Reduced Capacity:** In response to low profitability and losses, insurers **leave the market** or **reduce the amount of business they write**.  
* **Cycle Restart:** This restriction in the availability of insurance eventually reduces capacity/supply, putting pressure on premium rates to increase and restarting the cycle.

### **3\. Loss Ratios and Profitability**

* **High Loss Ratios:** The low premiums lead to high loss ratios, making the business generally **unprofitable** or **less profitable**. The underlying capital model should reflect **rising loss ratios** in a softening market.  
* **Reserving Cycle Correlation:** Studies suggest a 'reserving cycle' correlated with the underwriting cycle. In a soft market, incurred claims development patterns are **slower to develop** (longer-tailed). An unadjusted projection may therefore **underestimate ultimate claims** in a soft market, exacerbating the problem as the premium inadequacy only comes to light later.

## **III. Actuarial Implications for Modeling**

The cycle necessitates specific considerations when pricing and modeling, particularly regarding premium and loss ratio inputs:

1. **Consistency:** Projected premium income and attaching loss ratios should be **consistent with the underwriting cycle stage** for the line of business being analyzed.  
2. **Uncertainty and Variability:** Assumptions about premium rates, volumes of business, and claims are subject to **increased variability** when modeling during uncertain periods of the cycle.  
3. **Data Reliability:** The data used by actuaries may be **less reliable** during certain market stages. For instance, prioritizing new business in a rapidly rising market might mean claims information is less up-to-date.  
4. **Modeling Loss Ratios:** When calculating overall rate level indications using the loss ratio method, the historical loss ratios must be **adjusted for rate change activity** (e.g., using a rate index) and for the effects of the underwriting cycle to ensure consistency.
