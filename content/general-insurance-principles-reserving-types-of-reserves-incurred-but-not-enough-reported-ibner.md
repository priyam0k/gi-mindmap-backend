### **Types of Reserves: A Foundation**

To appreciate IBNER, we must first place it within the broader framework of a general insurer's technical reserves. Technical reserves, or insurance reserves, are the amounts set aside for expected claim payments to policyholders, along with related expenses. They represent the insurer's liabilities and are a critical component of the balance sheet.

These liabilities can be broadly categorised into two main groups:

* **Past Liabilities:** These relate to accidents or losses that occurred *prior* to the accounting date. This is where our focus on IBNER primarily lies.  
* **Future Liabilities:** These relate to future insurance cover from policies for which premiums have already been received, often referred to as unexpired risks. This includes the Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR) and the Additional Unexpired Risk Reserve (AURR).

### **Incurred But Not Enough Reported (IBNER): The Nuance**

IBNER is a specific component of the **Outstanding Claims Reserve (OCR)**, which itself is the primary part of technical reserves covering past liabilities.

#### **Defining IBNER**

The sources define **IBNER** as: "The IBNER reserve is needed to cover expected increases (or decreases) in estimates for reported claims".

Think of it this way, my future Appointed Actuaries: when a claim is reported, the claims handler or assessor puts an initial estimate, known as a 'case estimate', on the file. This is their best judgment at that moment. However, as more information emerges, as legal processes unfold, or as the true extent of damage becomes clearer, this initial case estimate may prove to be insufficient â€“ or occasionally, too high. IBNER is the reserve for this *future development of already reported claims*.

#### **IBNER in Relation to Other Reserve Components**

It's vital to differentiate IBNER from other components of outstanding claims reserves:

1. **Outstanding Reported Claims Reserve:** This is the estimated reserve for claims the company *knows about* at the accounting date, reflecting settlement delays. IBNER covers the *changes* to these estimates.  
2. **Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) Claims Reserve:** This is for incidents that *have happened* but *have not been reported* to the insurer by the accounting date. The key distinction is that IBNR addresses claims not yet known, while IBNER addresses the future evolution of claims *already known and reported*.  
3. **Re-opened Claims Reserve:** This is for claims previously considered settled but which might require further payments later. The distinction here is that these were *closed* claims, whereas IBNER relates to *open* claims whose estimates are still developing.  
4. **Claims Handling Expenses (CHE) Reserve:** This covers the additional expenses (e.g., legal fees) incurred in settling claims. This reserve is distinct but often included within the broader claims provisions.

While insurers might not always show these explicitly as separate categories in their accounts, they *must* hold reserves to cover all these elements. For example, IBNER might be implicitly included within the IBNR reserve or even the outstanding reported claims reserve if only a two-component split is presented.

### **Reasons for IBNER's Emergence and Development**

The need for an IBNER provision arises from several practical realities in claims management and the inherent uncertainty in projecting future liabilities:

* **Reporting and Settlement Delays:** Changes in outstanding reported amounts can result from both reporting and settlement delays. Initial estimates may be rough due to incomplete information, and as more details emerge over time, the estimate is refined, leading to an IBNER movement.  
* **Inaccuracy of Initial Case Estimates:** Our initial estimates for reported claims will often prove to be incorrect. If we've under-reserved initially, the amounts will increase as the claim develops, leading to positive IBNER. The opposite occurs with over-reserving. This is particularly true for complex claims like Directors & Officers (D\&O) liability, where there can be significant uncertainty in the claim value even before a formal claim is made.  
* **Operational Changes:**  
  * **Changes in Claims Handling Procedures/Philosophy:** If the insurer's policy on setting case reserves changes (e.g., from an initial nominal amount to a more realistic estimate), this will influence the development of incurred claims.  
  * **Claims Backlogs or Clear-outs:** Delays in processing claims (backlogs) can lead to unusually low claims development factors. Conversely, a concerted effort to settle old claims (clear-outs) can result in unusually high paid claims development or decreases in incurred claims, impacting IBNER.  
  * **Data Inconsistencies:** Changes in data storage protocols or reliance on third-party claims handlers who may have different practices can distort claims development patterns, affecting IBNER.  
* **Legal and Economic Influences:** Changes in the legal environment, court rulings, or unexpected inflation can significantly alter the ultimate cost of claims, even those already reported, contributing to IBNER. This is particularly relevant for long-tailed classes.  
* **Latent Claims:** While latent claims (e.g., asbestos, pollution, health hazards) are a distinct category, their long-tail nature and evolving understanding of liability mean that even once "emerging" (Stage 3), their full extent is still developing, leading to IBNER-like adjustments as liability estimates become clearer.  
* **Reinsurance Business:** Reinsurers often explicitly hold IBNER because the original estimates provided by direct writers can be highly uncertain, necessitating explicit recognition of future development.

### **Actuarial Treatment and Implications of IBNER**

Understanding and appropriately reserving for IBNER is fundamental to sound actuarial practice and the financial health of an insurer.

#### **In Reserving Methodologies:**

* **Triangulation Methods:** When using incurred claims data in triangulation methods (e.g., chain ladder), if the incurred claims definition includes an allowance for IBNR and IBNER, the method effectively projects the corrections to earlier estimates. If only paid claims \+ case estimates are used as "incurred," the method largely projects the IBNR, and IBNER becomes part of the development *within* the reported claims.  
* **Separate Modelling:** Modelling IBNER and pure IBNR separately is often advantageous. It helps determine whether a change in the required outstanding claims reserve is due to an increase in reported claim numbers (pure IBNR) or due to changes in the prudence/optimism of original case estimate assumptions (IBNER).  
* **Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) Method:** This method is valuable where data is sparse, especially for more recent cohorts or long-tailed portfolios. It estimates the proportion of claims yet to be incurred or paid, effectively calculating the estimated future incurred claims (which can include IBNER).  
* **Berquist-Sherman Method:** This technique specifically adjusts historical development patterns for changes in case reserving adequacy to ensure consistency with current practices.  
* **Impact of Large Claims:** Large claims often have different development patterns from attritional claims and can distort triangulations. It is common practice to remove them from general development analysis and project them separately. The future development of these large, complex claims will be a significant component of IBNER.  
* **Reinsurance Reserving:** For ceded reinsurance business, particularly non-proportional, IBNER development is a critical consideration. It should be applied to *open* claims (not settled ones) to account for the evolution of known liabilities. The IBNER development factors for ceded business can be derived by analysing historical loss developments from cedants.

#### **In Financial Reporting and Solvency:**

* **Solvency II:** Under Solvency II, technical provisions comprise both claims and premium provisions. The claims provisions relate to events that have already happened, and this includes IBNER. The best estimate of technical provisions is a probability-weighted average of future cashflows, reflecting all assumptions that best reflect the characteristics of the underlying portfolio.  
* **Reporting Requirements:** When communicating reserve estimates, it is crucial to clearly state which elements are included, such as allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses, and whether the reserves are net or gross of reinsurance, salvage, or subrogation. This transparency helps users understand the basis and potential uncertainties, including those related to IBNER.  
* **Capital Modelling:** IBNER directly contributes to **reserving risk** within a capital model. Reserving risk is the risk that actual experience differs from expected, specifically for business already written/earned. Capital models need to account for future variability (e.g., reserve shocks) and future latent claims affecting existing business, which inherently involves IBNER-type development. Assumptions for capital models need to consider historical reserve movements and input from claims, reserving, and underwriting staff on views regarding extreme reserve movements.

In summary, IBNER is far more than just an acronym; it represents the dynamic and uncertain nature of reported claims. Its accurate estimation requires robust data, appropriate actuarial methods, careful consideration of internal and external influences, and transparent communication. As you progress in your actuarial career, managing this uncertainty will be a cornerstone of your role.
