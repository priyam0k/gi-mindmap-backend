As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on **Fixed Benefits Insurance**, positioning it within the broader framework of the **Specific Product Lines** you need to understand for your exams. This category of cover is distinct from liability and property damage insurance, primarily because the payout is a pre-agreed, fixed amount rather than a direct indemnity for a quantifiable financial loss.

### **General Insurance Products: Fixed Benefits Insurance**

Fixed Benefits Insurance is one of the four main categories of general insurance cover, alongside liability, property damage, and financial loss. Its defining characteristic is that the policy pays a specified, fixed monetary amount upon the occurrence of a defined event, irrespective of the actual financial loss incurred by the policyholder.

The primary example of this product line discussed in the sources is **Personal Accident (PA) insurance**.

#### **1\. Customer Need and Benefits Provided**

The core customer need is to receive a cash sum to help cope with the consequences of a serious accident. While it is impossible to financially quantify the value of losing a limb, a fixed benefit provides some level of compensation.

* **Benefits Provided**: The policy pays specified, fixed amounts if the insured party suffers a defined injury (e.g., loss of a limb) or accidental death. This is explicitly **not indemnity insurance**.  
* **Structure of Benefits**:  
  * The policyholder can often select a desired level of cover, for example, by purchasing a number of "units" of sum insured (e.g., a unit might be Â£25,000).  
  * A **continental scale** is frequently used, where lesser injuries receive a set proportion of the full sum insured.  
  * Benefits can also be a fixed amount per day, week, or month for periods of hospitalisation or disability, often after a waiting period.  
* **Unlimited Insurable Interest**: An individual is generally assumed to have an unlimited financial interest in their own life and well-being. However, insurers must be cautious to avoid moral hazard by not granting excessively large sums insured for relatively minor injuries.

#### **2\. Insured Perils**

The central peril is any form of accident that results in a specified injury, permanent total disablement, or accidental death.

* **Exclusions**: Policies commonly exclude losses arising from dangerous pastimes, suicide or self-inflicted injury, or illegal activities by the policyholder.  
* **Context in Other Policies**: Personal accident cover is often included as a fixed benefit within other package policies, such as comprehensive motor insurance, where benefits are paid for specified injuries arising from a motor accident.

#### **3\. Basis of Cover**

Personal Accident insurance is typically written on a **losses-occurring basis**. This means the policy covers accidents that happen during the policy period, regardless of when a claim is reported.

---

#### **4\. Claim Characteristics**

Personal Accident is generally a **short-tail** class of business.

* **Reporting and Settlement Delays**:  
  * Claims are usually reported and settled quickly because the occurrence of an accident is typically a clear-cut event.  
  * A notable exception is a claim for **permanent total disablement**, where it may take several months or even years for the claimant's condition to stabilise enough for a final assessment to be made.  
  * For accidental death claims, there can be reporting delays if dependents are not immediately aware that the policy existed.  
* **Claim Frequency**: Tends to be reasonably stable.  
* **Claim Severity**: The benefit amount is fixed and known in advance. However, claims can be for large amounts, with cover of several hundred thousand pounds per person not being uncommon.

#### **5\. Pricing: Exposure Measures and Rating Factors**

##### **ðŸ”¸ 5.1 Exposure Measure**

The most appropriate measure of exposure is the **person-year multiplied by the sum insured**.

* **Practical Issues**: In many cases, especially for group or family policies, the full details of every individual covered are not available. Therefore, a more practical measure like **member-year** or **employee-year** may be used instead. Where a standard rate is used to cover a whole family, the insurer is exposed to selection risk, as the policy may be more attractive to larger families.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 5.2 Risk and Rating Factors**

The premium is primarily determined by factors that influence the likelihood of an accident.

* **Primary Factor**: The prime rating factor is **occupation**. Individuals in dangerous occupations (e.g., demolition work) present a much higher risk than those in safer clerical roles.  
* **Other Key Factors**:  
  * **Sum Insured**: A direct driver of the potential claim cost.  
  * **Age**: Not usually a major factor until old age is reached, and cover is not normally sold to the elderly.  
  * **Dangerous Pastimes**: Hobbies like motor racing or pot-holing increase risk and will be reflected in the premium.  
  * **Health Condition**: The insured's state of health can be a determinant of risk.  
  * **Gender**: Historically a factor, as women tend to be less prone to accidents, but its use is now banned in the EU.

*Exam Coach Tip: Fixed benefits insurance, especially Personal Accident, is a good example of a product that contrasts with the principle of indemnity. In an exam question, you should immediately highlight its **fixed benefit** nature and its generally **short-tail** claim characteristics. Discussing the use of a **continental scale** for benefits or the challenge of selecting an appropriate **exposure measure** (person-year vs. member-year) for group policies will demonstrate a deeper understanding of the product's practical application.*
