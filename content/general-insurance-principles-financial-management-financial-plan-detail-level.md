As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on the **Detail Level**, also known as **granularity**, required within a **Financial Plan**. This is a critical aspect of Financial Management that bridges high-level strategy with practical implementation. While SP8 focuses on pricing, understanding the appropriate level of detail in business planning is a higher-order skill that demonstrates your grasp of how pricing decisions fit into the insurer's overall financial strategy.

### **Financial Management: Detail Level in a Financial Plan**

A financial plan is the strategic document that translates an insurer's high-level goals into measurable targets and financial projections. The level of detail, or granularity, at which this plan is constructed is a crucial consideration. An effective plan must balance the need for sufficient detail to be meaningful and actionable against the risk of becoming overly complex, which can lead to spurious accuracy and inefficient analysis.

The appropriate level of detail is not uniform across all components of the plan; it varies depending on the specific element being modelled, the purpose of the investigation, and the quality and quantity of available data.

#### **1\. The Principle of Proportionality and Granularity**

A core principle governing the detail level of a financial plan and its supporting models is that it should be **proportionate to the nature, scale, and complexity of the risks undertaken**. An insurer writing a single, simple personal lines product in one region will require a less detailed plan than a multinational insurer writing multiple complex commercial lines across various jurisdictions.

The objective is to achieve a balance: the model should be rigorous enough for its purpose without being so complex that the results are difficult to interpret or communicate.

#### **2\. Detail Level for Key Components of the Financial Plan**

The required granularity varies for each key assumption within the financial plan:

**2.1 Future Written Premium Income** Projections for premium income should be made at a reasonably detailed level to be useful. A high-level aggregate projection is insufficient. The plan should project premium:

* **Separately for each Line of Business (LoB):** This is the minimum level of detail required, as different lines will have different growth prospects, profitability, and exposure to the underwriting cycle.  
* **Split by Source of Business:** Where possible, splitting projections by distribution channel (eg, direct, broker, tied agent) is highly beneficial. This allows the plan to account for different commission structures and shifts in the distribution mix, which can materially affect future expenses and profitability.  
* **Time Interval:** Projections should be made for appropriate time intervals, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually, depending on the level of accuracy needed and the seasonality of the business.

**2.2 Future Claims** Claims are the largest and most volatile component, requiring a significant level of detail in the financial plan. Projections are often split by:

* **Type of Loss:**  
  * **Attritional Claims:** Routine, smaller claims are often modelled in aggregate, perhaps using a loss ratio model.  
  * **Large Claims:** Less frequent, high-severity claims are often modelled separately using frequency/severity techniques to avoid distorting the attritional projections.  
  * **Catastrophe Claims:** These are projected using outputs from specialised catastrophe models or, if unavailable, dedicated frequency/severity methods.  
* **Source of Claims:** The model must distinguish between claims arising from different cohorts to ensure an accurate run-off of liabilities. This includes separating claims from:  
  * Development on historical notified claims (IBNER).  
  * Claims incurred but not yet reported (IBNR).  
  * The unexpired portion of existing business.  
  * Future business to be written under the plan.

**2.3 Future Expenses** Expense projections are a function of other assumptions in the plan. The detail level should be sufficient to capture this relationship:

* **Commission:** Modelled as a percentage of written premium, potentially split by source of business if commission rates vary by channel.  
* **Other Expenses:** Projections for costs like staffing and rent require discussion with management and are linked to the assumed business growth under the plan.

**2.4 Reinsurance** The financial plan must model the impact of the reinsurance programme in detail, considering existing arrangements and likely future changes. This is particularly important for smaller companies that purchase more reinsurance.

#### **3\. Data Granularity: The Foundation of a Detailed Plan**

The level of detail achievable in a financial plan is fundamentally limited by the quality and granularity of the underlying data. For an insurer to build a robust and detailed financial plan, its information systems must capture data at a highly granular level.

* **Policy and Claim Level Data:** Modern ratemaking and financial analysis require detailed historical information about each policy and claim. Company databases should ideally store policy and claim information separately but be linkable via a policy identifier.  
* **Transactional Detail:** The most flexible systems capture individual transactions. For example, a claims database record would represent a single payment or a change in reserve. This allows data to be aggregated in various ways (eg, by accident year, policy year) to support different types of analyses.  
* **Risk Characteristics:** For classification ratemaking and detailed business mix analysis, the system must store characteristics for each risk, such as rating variables and underwriting variables. This allows the insurer to analyse profitability and growth at a very granular segment level.

If the preferred detailed data is not available, the actuary must use judgment to overcome the deficiencies, understanding that this introduces additional uncertainty into the financial plan.

#### **4\. Balancing Detail with Credibility**

While detail is desirable, the actuary must balance this against the need for statistical credibility. The process of risk classification involves grouping risks into a sufficient number of levels to ensure homogeneity, while being careful not to create overly granular groups that lack the stability and volume of data needed for accurate estimation. This principle applies directly to the level of segmentation within a financial plan; projecting results for a tiny, volatile segment of the business may produce statistically unreliable forecasts.

In conclusion, the detail level of a financial plan is a critical choice that must align with the insurer's complexity and strategic objectives. A robust plan is built upon a foundation of granular data and involves projecting key components like premium, claims, and expenses at a level of detail—such as by LoB, source, and claim type—that provides meaningful insights for financial management and decision-making.
