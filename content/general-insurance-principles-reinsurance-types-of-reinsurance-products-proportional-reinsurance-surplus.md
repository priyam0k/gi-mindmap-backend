As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on **Surplus Reinsurance**, placing it within the larger context of **Proportional Reinsurance**. Understanding Surplus is crucial as it represents a more flexible and targeted approach to risk management compared to Quota Share, making it a highly examinable topic in SP7, SP8, and SA3 \[11, 12, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **Types of Reinsurance Products**

#### **ðŸ”¹ Proportional Reinsurance**

Recall that under proportional reinsurance, the insurer (cedant) and the reinsurer share the premiums and losses for each risk according to a pre-agreed proportion \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. This method is a key tool for increasing an insurer's capacity to accept larger risks \[SP7.pdf\]. A core financial feature is the payment of a **ceding commission** by the reinsurer to the cedant to contribute towards acquisition and administrative costs \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

The two main types of proportional reinsurance are **Quota Share** and **Surplus** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. This note will focus on Surplus reinsurance.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2\. Surplus Reinsurance**

##### **2.1 Definition and Mechanism**

**Definition**: Surplus reinsurance is a form of proportional reinsurance that offers more flexibility than Quota Share \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. The ceding insurer establishes a "retention" or "line," which is the maximum amount of a risk it wishes to retain for its own account. For any policy where the Sum Insured or Estimated Maximum Loss (EML) exceeds this retention, the surplus amount is ceded to the reinsurer \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Mechanism**: The proportion of premium and claims shared between the cedant and reinsurer varies for each individual risk \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
  * The cedant sets its retention (or "line"), for example, Â£200,000 \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
  * If a policy is written with an EML of Â£1,000,000, the cedant retains Â£200,000 (20%) and cedes the Â£800,000 surplus (80%) to the reinsurer \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. Premiums and any subsequent losses for this policy are then shared in that 20:80 ratio \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
  * If another policy is written with an EML below the retention (e.g., Â£150,000), the cedant retains 100% of that risk and cedes nothing to the surplus treaty \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Capacity and Lines**: The reinsurer's maximum cover is typically expressed as a multiple of the cedant's retention, known as the number of "lines" \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\]. For example, a "10 line" surplus treaty with a cedant retention of Â£250,000 has a total capacity of Â£2,750,000 (the cedant's line of Â£250k \+ 10 reinsurer lines of Â£250k) \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, 61, 1423, 1424\]. If a risk exceeds this total capacity, a second (or even third) surplus treaty may be arranged \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, 1435\].  
* **Obligation Basis**: Surplus treaties are commonly written on a **Facultative/Obligatory (Fac/Oblig)** basis. This means the insurer has the choice ("facultative") of whether to cede a risk to the treaty, but the reinsurer is obliged to accept any risk offered, provided it meets the treaty criteria \[Reinsurance.pdf, 4539\]. This creates a risk of adverse selection for the reinsurer \[Reinsurance.pdf\].

##### **2.2 Purpose and Strategic Use**

Surplus reinsurance is a more targeted tool than Quota Share and is used for specific strategic purposes:

* **Writing Larger Individual Risks**: Its primary purpose is to allow an insurer to increase its capacity to accept larger individual risks than its own financial strength would otherwise permit \[Reinsurance.pdf, 1444\].  
* **Balancing the Portfolio**: It is highly suitable for classes where risk sizes vary widely, such as commercial fire or other property lines \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. It allows the insurer to retain smaller, more predictable risks in full while ceding a larger proportion of the bigger, more volatile risks, thereby achieving a more balanced net portfolio \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Efficient Risk Management**: Because it specifically targets larger risks, it is a more efficient method of managing portfolio volatility compared to a Quota Share arrangement, which cedes a fixed percentage of every risk regardless of size \[Reinsurance.pdf\].

##### **2.3 Advantages and Disadvantages**

A common exam question involves comparing Quota Share and Surplus reinsurance. A strong answer will clearly articulate the trade-offs.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Flexibility**: The insurer can choose its retention level for each risk (up to the treaty maximum), allowing it to retain more of its profitable, smaller business while protecting itself on larger exposures \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. | **Administratively Complex**: It requires the insurer to assess, record, and track the retention and cession for each individual risk, which is significantly more administrative work than a simple Quota Share treaty \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. |
| **Efficient Risk Management**: It is a more efficient tool than Quota Share for managing portfolio volatility because it specifically targets the larger, more volatile risks \[Reinsurance.pdf\]. | **Risk of Adverse Selection**: The common Fac/Oblig basis exposes the reinsurer to the risk that the cedant will only cede its less profitable business to the treaty \[Reinsurance.pdf, 4539\]. |
| **Increased Capacity for Large Risks**: It is highly effective at enabling an insurer to write larger individual risks than it could otherwise support with its own capital \[Reinsurance.pdf, 1444\]. | **Unsuitable for Liability Classes**: It is unsuitable for liability business where there is no effective Sum Insured or EML, making it impossible to determine the "surplus" to be ceded \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. |

#### **Exam Coach Tip:**

When discussing Surplus reinsurance, you must frame it as a **flexible but administratively complex tool for managing portfolios with varying risk sizes**. Your exam answers should always contrast it with Quota Share.

* **Scenario Application**: For an established **commercial property insurer**, a Surplus treaty is an excellent choice. The insurer faces risks of vastly different sizes (e.g., small shops vs. large factories). Surplus allows it to retain the smaller, more predictable shop risks in full (and keep all the profit) while ceding a large proportion of the high-value factory risks to increase its capacity and protect its balance sheet from a single large fire \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

* **Contrast with Quota Share**: A high-scoring answer will explain that while Quota Share is a blunt instrument for portfolio-level goals (like overall capital relief), Surplus is a "sharper," more targeted tool. It allows the cedant to keep more of what it considers its profitable business (the smaller risks) and only cede what is necessary for capacity and volatility management \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

* **Key Phraseology**: Use terms like "flexible," "administratively complex," "Facultative/Obligatory basis," "adverse selection," and "unsuitable for liability lines" to demonstrate a clear, SP8-level commercial and technical understanding \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, 4539\].
