As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, I confirm that weather impact, analyzed through **Seasonal** and **Local Variation**, forms a core part of the **Climate and Environmental Factors** that introduce significant operational and financial uncertainty for general insurers,,,.

## **I. Seasonal Variation and Claims Experience**

The most immediate and obvious way in which weather introduces variability is through **seasonality**,,,.

### **1\. Patterns and Regional Differences**

Weather patterns vary significantly by region,,,. In temperate climes, seasonality follows the spring/summer/autumn/winter pattern,,,. In tropical climes, patterns may involve dry seasons, wet seasons, or monsoon seasons,,,. The specific pattern and associated risks vary even within geographic zones due to differences in weather characteristics and local building codes,,,.

### **2\. Impact on Specific Claim Types**

Certain claims exhibit distinct seasonal patterns:

* **Motor Claims:** Motor policies typically incur more claims in winter when weather conditions are more hazardous.  
* **Subsidence and Heave:** The problems of subsidence of buildings and land heave are generally more likely to occur in the **summer**, particularly when the weather is very dry and hot,,,. The ground shrinks when desiccated (dried up), causing structural damage that is worsened when the ground expands during the drought break,,,. These often result in large claims, especially for domestic property,,,.  
* **Reinsurance Implication:** Importantly, because subsidence damage occurs gradually over time, it may **not** be covered by catastrophe Excess of Loss (XL) reinsurance,,,.

### **3\. Actuarial and Reserving Considerations**

If seasonality is significant, it may need to be allowed for in earned premium payment patterns,. Furthermore, seasonality can impact the claims development pattern, both within a cohort and between cohorts (if exposure periods differ). While seasonality may not affect annual development factors, it can make quarterly factors appear less smooth.

## **II. Local Variation and Location-Based Risk**

The vulnerability of property to weather events varies significantly by **location**, often in ways that are not always immediately obvious,,,, making underwriting a mass product difficult,,,.

### **1\. Specific Local Risk Drivers**

* **Flooding:** Properties built on flood plains or low-lying lands near the coast are clearly prone to flooding,,,. However, other areas may be vulnerable, such as hillside properties where water is channeled as it runs downhill,,,.  
* **Shelter vs. Exposure:** Two properties in the same small town might face very different weather risks if one is in a sheltered, dry spot under a hill while the other is in an exposed area next to a river,,,.

### **2\. Insurer Response and Pricing Techniques**

To overcome the difficulties introduced by local variation in mass products, insurers employ increasingly granular data and sophisticated modeling techniques:

* **Data Precision:** Insurers are requesting more precise details about the location of the property and previous claim history,,,.  
* **Granular Rating:** Rating is performed according to a more precise measure of location, such as using the **full postal code** rather than just the first few characters,,,.  
* **Territorial Ratemaking:** Geography is acknowledged as one of the primary drivers of claims experience and is a widely used rating variable. Companies typically define territories as collections of small geographic units (e.g., postal/zip codes, counties, census blocks).  
* **Multivariate Analysis:** Actuaries employ sophisticated multivariate models, such as Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), which incorporate geographic explanatory variables, including geo-demographic and **geo-physical variables** (e.g., average rainfall), often sourced from third parties and merged with the insurerâ€™s database via a geographic unit.

### **3\. Political Implications**

If insurers attempt to fully reflect the true location-based risk (for example, high flood risk) in their premiums, this could cause **political difficulties**, potentially leading to some properties becoming uninsurable against certain perils,. In response, some countries implement nationally-administered insurance schemes or pooling arrangements, such as Flood Re in the UK,,,.
