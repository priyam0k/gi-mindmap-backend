### **1\. Introduction: Types of Reserves – The Foundational Context**

First, let's firmly establish where UPR sits within the broader structure of an insurer's financial obligations. An insurer's balance sheet features **Technical Reserves**, which are sums set aside for expected future claim payments and their associated expenses. These reserves are not merely about covering claims; they also account for the costs of handling those claims and the future unearned portions of premiums.

Technical Reserves are fundamentally divided into two main categories based on the timing of the underlying events:

* **(a) Past Liabilities**: These encompass claims and their related expenses for events that have *already occurred* before the accounting date. This category includes reserves for outstanding reported claims, Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims, Incurred But Not Enough Reported (IBNER) claims, re-opened claims, and crucially, claims handling expenses associated with these past events \[114(a), 115, 116(e), 146, 571(a), 572, 573(e), 606\].  
* **(b) Future Liabilities**: This is where our focus, the **Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR)**, primarily resides. These liabilities pertain to future insurance cover from policies for which premiums have already been received but for which the full period of cover has not yet expired \[114(b), 121, 147, 571(b), 578, 606\]. Alongside UPR, this category also includes the Additional Unexpired Risk Reserve (AURR).

An insurer will always hold reserves to cover all these items, even if they are not explicitly shown as separate categories in the accounts; for instance, UPR might be shown broadly as part of "reserves for unexpired policies".

### **2\. Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR): Definition and Purpose**

Let's get precise with our definition of UPR. The **Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR)** is defined as "the portion of premiums held in respect of unexpired exposure". It represents the premiums that have been received by the insurer but have not yet been "earned" because the period of insurance cover to which they relate extends beyond the accounting date.

The core purpose of UPR is to meet the future liabilities arising from:

* Expected **future claim events** that will occur from policies for which the insurer has already received premiums, but for which the cover period is still ongoing.  
* The **claims and expenses** expected to be incurred in the future from these unexpired portions of existing policies.

Think of it as the insurer's commitment to provide coverage for the unexpired portion of the policy term; the premium has been paid, but the service (risk coverage) is yet to be fully delivered.

### **3\. Calculation of UPR: Methodologies and Key Considerations**

Calculating UPR involves a retrospective assessment, looking at premiums already received. Here's how it's approached and what actuaries must consider:

#### **3.1 Basic Calculation Approach**

The simplest method is a **straight averaging basis**. For example, for an annual policy with six months remaining, half of the premium might be reserved. Similarly, for a policy with one month to run, one-twelfth of the premium might be held.

#### **3.2 Fundamental Weaknesses and Adjustments**

While simple, the straight averaging approach has significant weaknesses in practice:

* **Uneven Risk Spread**: It ignores that the risk from a policy may not be spread evenly over the period of cover, such as seasonal effects (e.g., higher claim propensity in summer for travel policies).  
* **Inflation**: It doesn't inherently account for future inflation, which impacts claim costs over time.

To address these, actuaries may need to develop a suitable formula that reflects the progression of the incidence and size of the risk.

#### **3.3 Allowance for Acquisition Costs**

A crucial adjustment to the gross premium is for **acquisition costs**, which are initial expenses (e.g., commission, documentation, set-up costs) largely incurred at the inception of the policy. The premium available to meet claims, ongoing expenses, and profit is the premium *after* deducting these costs.

Two main approaches exist for reflecting acquisition costs in the UPR calculation:

* **UPR Net of DAC (Deferred Acquisition Costs)**: The UPR is directly reduced for acquisition expenses before the calculation is applied to the office premium. This is calculated as: `UPR = proportion of risk unexpired × (premium - acquisition costs)`.  
* **UPR Gross of DAC**: The UPR is not directly reduced, but a Deferred Acquisition Cost (DAC) is set up as an asset that reduces over the exposure period of the policy.

On a **wind-up basis**, the insurer's liability would typically be the full unearned proportion of the office premium (UPR gross of DAC), unless the insurer can reclaim commission from the broker.

#### **3.4 Other Calculation Methods and Practicalities**

* **Non-Annual Premiums**: For policies with different or more frequent premium payments (e.g., single premiums for mortgage indemnity), the same principles apply, requiring adjustments for the length of the premium period.  
* **Specific Methods**: The sources mention methods like the "eighths method" and "halves method" for calculating UPR, based on assumptions about when policies incept on average (mid-point of quarter/year respectively). The "24ths method" is also mentioned.  
* **Consistency**: Regardless of the method, there must be consistency between the assumption regarding the period to which the UPR is apportioned, the credit of the full premium received, and any credits or debits for outstanding or overpaid premiums. For instance, if UPR is calculated for a policy where premiums are yet to be received, credit for that expected premium must be given in the accounts.

### **4\. Relationship with Unexpired Risk Reserve (URR) and Additional Unexpired Risk Reserve (AURR)**

While UPR is a retrospective assessment, a forward-looking or **prospective approach** is also essential. This leads us to the **Unexpired Risk Reserve (URR)** and the **Additional Unexpired Risk Reserve (AURR)**.

#### **4.1 Unexpired Risk Reserve (URR)**

The URR is a prospective assessment of the amount an insurer needs to hold *now* to cover the expected claims and expenses arising from the unexpired portion of existing policies. This is distinct from UPR, which focuses on the unearned portion of premiums already received.

#### **4.2 Comparison: UPR vs URR**

Ideally, an insurer would expect its **UPR (net of acquisition costs) to be greater than its URR**. This indicates that the premiums charged are sufficient to cover expected claims and expenses, implying that a profit is anticipated to emerge from the unexpired risks in the coming months. In such cases, the insurer would typically hold a reserve equal to the UPR.

However, if the estimated cost of future claims and expenses from unexpired risks (URR) is greater than the unearned premium reserve (UPR), this signals that the company expects to make a loss on these policies. In such a scenario, the UPR alone would be insufficient, and the insurer must establish **Additional Unexpired Risk Reserves (AURR)** to cover this anticipated shortfall.

The formula for AURR is straightforward: `AURR = URR - UPR (with a minimum of zero)`. If AURR is not zero, it typically suggests that the insurer has been writing business on unprofitable terms.

#### **4.3 Key Considerations for URR and AURR**

* **Uncertainty**: The URR is often considered "open to more uncertainty" than the UPR, as it relies on future claims experience, which is inherently unknown, unlike past premiums charged.  
* **Inclusions**: The future liabilities in URR calculations should explicitly include unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE) and any allowed or required discounting.  
* **Terminology**: Be mindful that the term "unexpired risk reserve" can sometimes ambiguously refer to either the total URR or just the additional AURR. Always clarify the intended meaning in practice and your own work.  
* **Regulatory Impact (Solvency II)**: Notably, with the advent of Solvency II in the UK and other EU countries, insurers are *required* to estimate reserves for unexpired exposures using a prospective approach (i.e., URR) rather than solely a retrospective approach (UPR). This means a robust URR calculation is paramount for regulatory compliance.  
* **Accounting Impact**: Holding an AURR impacts the emergence of profit, deferring it and anticipating a loss when business is initially written at unprofitable rates.

### **5\. UPR in Broader Actuarial and Financial Contexts**

The significance of UPR extends beyond just a line item on the balance sheet:

#### **5.1 Financial Reporting and Accounting**

* **Balance Sheet**: UPR is clearly a liability on the insurer's balance sheet, falling under "Technical Reserves" or "Insurance Provisions".  
* **Profit & Loss (P\&L) Statement**: The calculation of "Net Earned Premium" on the P\&L statement directly incorporates the Unearned Premium Reserve: `Net earned premium = net premiums written + net UPR b/f - net UPR c/f`. This demonstrates how UPR plays a vital role in determining the underwriting result.  
* **IFRS 17**: This accounting standard, effective from January 2023, requires discounting of reserves, premium provisions, and expense provisions, directly impacting how UPR and its associated cashflows are recognised and influence declared profit through the unwinding of discount.

#### **5.2 Taxation**

Provisions for unearned premiums (UPR) are generally allowed for tax purposes, provided they are calculated with sufficient accuracy and meet certain conditions. Similarly, Additional Unexpired Risk Reserves (AURR) may be accepted under some tax regimes, though restrictions might apply (e.g., needing statistical proof).

#### **5.3 Capital Modelling**

UPR plays a role in defining the scope of underwriting and reserving risk within capital models. Depending on the specific modelling date and the policy inception, the starting Unearned Premium Reserve can be classified as part of either:

* **Underwriting Risk**: If modelling capital as at a date *prior* to policy inception.  
* **Reserving Risk**: If modelling capital as at or *after* policy inception.

Assumptions regarding premiums, including those impacting UPR, are key inputs for capital models, influencing projections of overall claims and financial position.

#### **5.4 Pricing**

In premium rating, the concept of UPR is inherently linked to how premiums are "earned" over the policy term. The premium formula accounts for various costs, including those tied to the unearned portion. Actuaries determine the "pure risk premium" to cover expected claims and then add loadings for expenses, profit, and investment income. The UPR calculation, particularly the allowance for initial expenses (DAC), directly influences how this "net" premium is considered.

### **6\. Key Learnings for the SP7 Candidate**

* **Distinguish Definitions**: Be crystal clear on the difference between UPR (retrospective, portion of premium unearned) and URR (prospective, estimate of future claims/expenses from unexpired risks). This is a common area of confusion, so articulate it precisely.  
* **Regulatory Imperative**: Understand that Solvency II mandates a prospective (URR) view for unexpired risk reserves, moving beyond a simple UPR calculation for regulatory purposes.  
* **Actuarial Judgement**: The calculation of UPR and especially AURR, is not purely mechanistic. It requires significant actuarial judgment, especially when dealing with uneven risk profiles or assessing future profitability from unexpired business.  
* **Interconnectedness**: Recognise how UPR affects, and is affected by, other aspects of the insurer's operations – from taxation and P\&L reporting to capital requirements and premium setting.  
* **Data Quality**: The accuracy of UPR and AURR depends heavily on the quality and granularity of data regarding premiums, acquisition costs, and historical risk incidence.

By mastering these nuances, you demonstrate a comprehensive grasp of an insurer's liabilities and are well-equipped to navigate complex reserving challenges. Keep practicing those definitions and their applications\!
