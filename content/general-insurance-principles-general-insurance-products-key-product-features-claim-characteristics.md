As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note sequence on **Claim Characteristics**, positioning this topic as one of the six fundamental **Key Product Features** that define any general insurance product \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. A thorough grasp of claim characteristics is essential for SP8, as they directly influence the risk profile of a product and therefore have significant implications for pricing, reserving, capital requirements, and even investment strategy \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

### **The Larger Context: The Six Key Product Features**

When we analyse any general insurance product, we break it down into six fundamental features to understand the risks involved for the insurer. The Claim Characteristics describe the nature of claims arising from a product. The six features are \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\]:

1. Benefits Provided  
2. Insured Perils  
3. Basis for Cover  
4. Measures of Exposure  
5. **Claim Characteristics**  
6. Risk and Rating Factors

### **1\. Defining Claim Characteristics**

Claim characteristics refer to the ways in which, and the speed with which, claims originate, are reported, are settled, and are occasionally reopened \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. Analysing these characteristics helps the actuary to understand the nature of the liabilities, the degree of uncertainty, and the capital required to support the business \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

The principal aspects to consider under this feature are:

* The distinction between **Short-tail vs Long-tail** business.  
* The **Frequency** and **Severity** distribution of claims.  
* The potential for **Accumulations** of risk.  
* The presence of **Latent Claims**.  
* The occurrence of **Nil Claims**.

Let's explore each of these in detail.

### **2\. Short-tail vs Long-tail Business**

This is a critical distinction that fundamentally shapes the risk profile of a product. The "tail" refers to the delay between a claim event occurring and its final settlement \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

#### **2.1 Short-tail Claims**

* **Definition:** Claims are generally reported quickly and settled quickly by the insurer \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Delays Involved:**  
  * **Reporting Delays:** The time from the event to notification is short. For example, a car accident is usually reported promptly \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
  * **Settlement Delays:** The time from notification to final payment is also short. The value of the loss is often straightforward to establish \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
* **Product Examples:** Most **Property Damage** insurance, such as motor own damage, household contents, and commercial property, are classic short-tail classes \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. Personal Accident is also generally short-tailed \[SP752.pdf\].  
* **Risks for the Insurer:**  
  * **Reserving Uncertainty:** Reserving is less uncertain because most claims for a given period are known and settled quickly \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * **Accumulation Risk:** The primary risk is the accumulation of many claims from a single catastrophic event, such as a hurricane, flood, or earthquake \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

#### **2.2 Long-tail Claims**

* **Definition:** A sizeable proportion of total claim payments take a long time for the insurer to settle \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
* **Delays Involved:**  
  * **Reporting Delays:** Can be considerable. For industrial diseases like asbestosis, the delay between exposure and claim notification can be decades \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. This gives rise to significant **Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR)** risk \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
  * **Settlement Delays:** Can also be very long, often taking several years. This is due to the time needed to establish liability, wait for a medical condition to stabilise, or resolve legal disputes \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
* **Product Examples:** Primarily **Liability Insurance**, such as Employers' Liability, Public Liability, and Professional Indemnity \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Risks for the Insurer:**  
  * **High Reserving Uncertainty:** Estimating the ultimate cost of claims is highly uncertain due to the long delays and the impact of inflation \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
  * **Sensitivity to Inflation:** Long-tail claims are highly exposed to various forms of inflation (price, wage, medical, and judicial/social inflation) which can dramatically increase the ultimate claim cost over the settlement period \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * **Capital Requirements:** Long-tail business requires substantial capital backing to cover the high degree of uncertainty \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

### **3\. Claim Frequency and Severity**

These two components determine the total expected claim cost and their distributions vary significantly by product type.

* **Claim Frequency:** This is the number of claims that occur. For some personal lines like motor and household, claim frequency is relatively high \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. For liability classes, it tends to be low \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Claim Severity:** This is the cost of an individual claim. The distribution of claim severity is a key characteristic.  
  * For most classes, a large proportion of claims are for small amounts (attritional claims), with a small number of very large claims \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * The distribution is typically highly skewed with a long upper tail, especially for liability classes. This is often modelled using distributions like the Lognormal or Pareto \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * Property claims tend to have a more consistent size distribution compared to the widely spread distributions of liability claims \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

### **4\. Accumulations of Risk**

An accumulation of risk occurs when a single event gives rise to claims under several different policies or from many risks under the same policy \[SP8 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\].

* **Property Classes:** These are highly prone to accumulations from a single catastrophic event affecting a specific geographic region. Examples include hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and civil disturbances \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. Accumulations can also arise from a common cause that is not a single incident, such as a very dry summer causing widespread subsidence claims \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Liability Classes:** Less susceptible to single-incident accumulations but highly exposed to accumulations from a single *cause*. The most notable example is exposure to asbestos, which has generated a huge number of claims under Employers' and Product Liability policies, with an aggregate cost expected to exceed that of any single event catastrophe \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. A court award in favour of one claimant can also trigger a large number of similar claims \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

### **5\. Latent Claims**

Latent claims are a particularly challenging feature of long-tail business.

* **Definition:** These are claims arising from perils that were unforeseen when the policy was originally written, or claims that become known many years after the cause of the loss \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP3628.pdf\].  
* **Examples:** Most latent claims arise from diseases caused by products or industrial processes (e.g., asbestos, pollution, harmful pharmaceuticals) but can also arise from faulty building construction or historical sexual abuse cases \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP3628.pdf\].  
* **Impact:** They create enormous uncertainty for insurers, particularly for policies written on a **losses-occurring basis**, as the insurer remains liable for claims from policies written decades ago \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. The development of the **claims-made basis** was partly a response to the problems posed by latent claims \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

### **6\. Nil Claims (or Zero Claims)**

This is a feature of general insurance that distinguishes it from life insurance and must be handled consistently in actuarial data analysis.

* **Definition:** A nil claim is a claim that results in no payment by the insurer \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Reasons for Occurrence:**  
  * The loss is below the policy excess \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * The claim is found to be invalid or for an excluded peril \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * The policyholder reports an incident but chooses not to proceed with the claim, often to protect a No-Claim Discount (NCD) \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Actuarial Implications:** Although there is no indemnity payment, nil claims still generate administrative expenses for the insurer. Their treatment in data analysis is critical: whether they are included or excluded from claim counts must be consistent with how average claim severities are calculated to avoid distorting the risk premium calculation \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].
