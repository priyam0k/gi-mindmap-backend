Of course. As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note on the crucial topic of **Monitoring Written Business**. This forms a key part of the wider actuarial investigation process, as outlined in both the SP8 and SP7 syllabuses. It is a practical application of the actuarial control cycle, where an insurer analyses emerging experience to assess performance, validate assumptions, and inform future strategic decisions, including pricing.

### **ðŸ“— Monitoring Written Business in the Context of Actuarial Investigations**

Actuarial investigations for pricing are fundamentally **prospective**; they use historical data to estimate future costs and determine if premium rates are adequate. However, once rates are implemented, the environment is not static. Market conditions, competitor actions, and customer behaviour can cause the actual experience to deviate from what was projected. Therefore, continuous monitoring of written business is essential to understand performance, identify issues early, and provide feedback into the next pricing review.

The sources highlight several key statistics and ratios that insurers rely on to monitor and evaluate the appropriateness of their rates and overall performance.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 1\. Monitoring Growth and Market Position**

Monitoring growth is a primary indicator of an insurer's competitive position and market acceptance. Insurers track several key metrics to understand portfolio movements and market dynamics.

* **Policy Growth Rate**: This measures the net change in the number of policies and is a function of attracting new business and retaining existing customers. Low or negative growth can indicate uncompetitive rates, while rapid growth may signal that rates are too low relative to the market, potentially attracting unprofitable business. The formula is:  
  * `% Policy Growth = (New Policies Written - Lost Policies) / Policies at Start of Period`  
* **Close Ratio (or Hit Ratio/Conversion Rate)**: This measures the rate at which prospective customers accept a new business quote. It is a key gauge of the competitiveness of rates for new business. A typical definition is:  
  * `Close Ratio = Number of Accepted Quotes / Total Number of Quotes`  
* **Retention Ratio (or Persistency Ratio)**: This measures the rate at which existing insureds renew their policies. It is a crucial indicator of competitiveness for renewal business and is closely examined following rate changes. A typical definition is:  
  * `Retention Ratio = Number of Policies Renewed / Number of Potential Renewal Policies`

These ratios are monitored at an aggregate level and by key customer segments (eg by age or territory) to identify specific areas of competitive strength or weakness. This analysis helps management understand the impact of pricing decisions and informs marketing strategies.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 2\. Monitoring Premiums**

It is crucial to monitor the premium being collected to ensure it aligns with projections and reflects the intended business mix. A key metric is the **Average Premium**.

* **Calculation**: `Average Premium = Premium / Number of Exposures`.  
* **Purpose**: When adjusted for rate changes, shifts in average premium highlight changes in the mix of business written. For example, a rising average premium might indicate a shift toward higher-risk segments, which could have implications for future loss costs. This analysis is a critical input into the **premium trend** component of a loss ratio ratemaking analysis, which aims to project historical premium to the level expected in the future policy period.

Actuaries will often use quarterly average written premium for this analysis, as written premium is a leading indicator of trends that will eventually emerge in earned premium.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 3\. Monitoring Claims and Losses**

The core of any pricing investigation is the projection of future losses. Monitoring emerging claims experience is vital for validating the assumptions used in those projections. The primary metrics are **Frequency** and **Severity**, which combine to form the **Pure Premium**.

* **Frequency**: A measure of the rate at which claims occur (`Number of Claims / Number of Exposures`). Monitoring frequency helps identify trends in claim incidence and measure the effectiveness of underwriting actions.  
* **Severity**: A measure of the average cost of claims (`Losses / Number of Claims`). Analysing severity provides information about loss trends and the impact of changes in claims handling procedures.  
* **Pure Premium (or Loss Cost)**: The average loss per exposure (`Losses / Number of Exposures`), which is the product of frequency and severity. Changes in pure premium highlight trends in overall loss costs.

Separating the analysis into frequency and severity provides a deeper understanding of the underlying drivers of loss trends. For example, a stable pure premium could be masking a worrying increase in frequency that is being offset by a temporary decrease in severity. These trends are a critical input into the **loss trend** component of the ratemaking analysis, which projects historical losses to the cost level expected in the future policy period.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 4\. Monitoring Expenses**

The premium must cover underwriting expenses in addition to losses and profit. The **Underwriting Expense Ratio** is the key metric for monitoring these costs.

* **Calculation**: `UW Expense Ratio = UW Expenses / Premium`.  
* **Analysis**: This ratio is monitored over time and benchmarked against other companies. The expense categories are often split:  
  * Expenses incurred at policy onset (eg commissions, acquisition costs) are compared to **written premium**.  
  * Expenses incurred throughout the policy term (eg general expenses) are compared to **earned premium**.  
* This matching ensures a more accurate estimation of the expense provisions needed for future rates. An unexpected increase in this ratio signals that the expense loading in the current rates may be inadequate.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 5\. The Overall View: Monitoring Profitability Ratios**

Ultimately, these individual components come together to determine profitability. Insurers use several key ratios to get an aggregate view of performance.

* **Loss Ratio**: This is a primary measure of rate adequacy, showing the portion of each premium dollar used to pay for losses and LAE (`Loss & LAE / Earned Premium`).  
* **Operating Expense Ratio (OER)**: This measures the portion of each premium dollar used for all operational spending (`(LAE / Earned Premium) + UW Expense Ratio`).  
* **Combined Ratio**: This is a primary measure of overall underwriting profitability, combining the loss and expense ratios. A combined ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while a ratio above 100% indicates a loss.

Monitoring these profitability ratios is fundamental to assessing whether the fundamental insurance equation is in balance and whether the company is on track to meet its profit targets. The results of this monitoring are a critical input for senior management's strategic planning and provide the trigger for the next round of detailed actuarial pricing investigations.
