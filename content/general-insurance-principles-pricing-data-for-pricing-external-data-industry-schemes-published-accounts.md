Of course. As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note on the use of **External Data**, focusing on industry schemes and published information, within the broader context of General Insurance Pricing. This is a critical area for SP8 as actuaries must often look beyond their own company's experience, especially when pricing new products, entering new markets, or when internal data lacks credibility.

### **ðŸ“— External Data in the Context of Data for Pricing**

While internal historical data is the primary resource for pricing existing insurance products, it is often necessary to supplement it with external information. External data becomes essential when an insurer is pricing a new line of business, where internal data is sparse or unstable, or simply to provide a benchmark for internal analyses. The SP8 syllabus emphasises the importance of understanding the various sources of external data, from formal industry schemes to publicly available competitor information.

When using any external data, the actuary has a professional responsibility to assess its reasonableness, appropriateness, and comprehensiveness for the intended purpose.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 1\. Industry Schemes and Data Calls (Statistical Plans)**

In many jurisdictions, regulators require insurers to submit data in a consistent format to industry service organisations or statistical agents. These organisations aggregate the data from many participating companies, creating a rich source of industry-wide information.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 1.1 Types and Providers**

* **Rating and Statistical Organisations**: In the US, organisations like the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI) for workers' compensation and the Insurance Services Office, Inc (ISO) for various other lines are prominent examples. These bodies collect and aggregate data, analyse it, and often make the results or the aggregated data itself available to participating companies. For workers' compensation, the NCCI provides insurers with **loss cost estimates**, which cover expected future losses and loss adjustment expenses, forming a key part of the final rate.  
* **Voluntary Data Reporting**: Insurers may voluntarily report data to organisations to create industry benchmarks. For example, the US "Fast Track Monitoring System" compiles quarterly loss data used by both insurers and regulators to analyse loss trends. Another example is the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), which compiles detailed data from member companies on loss information by car model.  
* **Regulatory Data Calls**: Regulators may initiate *ad hoc* data calls to address specific needs, for instance, requesting closed claim information on medical malpractice. This information is often made publicly available and can be a valuable supplement for an insurer's own analysis.  
* **Statistical Plans**: Regulators may promulgate statistical plans requiring insurers to file data in a specific format. For example, the Texas Private Passenger Automobile Statistical Plan was used to set state-wide benchmark rates and was publicly available for companies to use.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 1.2 Uses and Limitations**

The primary use of this data is to supplement internal analyses where a company's own data is sparse or unstable. Because the data is aggregated from across the industry, it is likely to have greater volume and statistical credibility than a single insurer's data.

However, there are significant limitations:

* **Heterogeneity and Relevance**: The aggregated data may not be directly relevant to a specific insurer. The industry-wide mix of business, underwriting rules, claims handling procedures, or expense levels may differ significantly from the company's own.  
* **Timeliness**: External data is often more out of date than internal data due to the time required to collect, collate, and distribute it.  
* **Detail**: The data may be less detailed or flexible than internal data, limiting the types of analysis that can be performed.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 2\. Published Information (Competitor Filings and Accounts)**

Publicly available information from competitors and regulatory bodies provides another crucial source of external data.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.1 Competitor Rate Filings and Manuals**

In many jurisdictions, insurers are required to file proposed rate changes with regulatory bodies, and these filings are often publicly accessible.

* **Content**: These filings typically include actuarial justification for the rate change and the new manual pages. They can provide valuable insights into competitor assumptions on overall loss cost trends, expense levels, and changes to rating variable differentials (eg, territorial or age-related relativities).  
* **Uses**: A new company can use a competitor's manual as a starting point to develop its own rates, making judgmental adjustments for expected differences in loss costs, expenses, or target markets.  
* **Limitations**: Relying on competitor filings requires great care.  
  * **Incomplete Picture**: It can be very difficult to piece together a competitor's complete rating manual, as typically only the changing pages are filed. Furthermore, crucial elements like underwriting rules for placing risks into different tiers or companies within a group are often proprietary and not filed publicly, meaning the manual information is incomplete.  
  * **Relevance**: Each company has a different book of business, target market (eg, preferred vs non-standard auto), expense structure, and operating procedures. If these differences are material, the competitor's data may not be relevant for another insurer's pricing.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.2 Published Accounts and Statutory Returns**

Insurers are required to produce annual financial statements (eg, Annual Statement and Insurance Expense Exhibit (IEE) in the US) that contain a significant amount of accounting data.

* **Content**: These reports contain historical premium and expense data, which can be used to derive expense provisions.  
* **Limitations**: This data is often not available at the fine level of detail needed for ratemaking. For example, homeowners data in the IEE might include renters and mobile homes, making it inappropriate for deriving expense provisions specifically for standard homeowners policies. The ideal source is always internal expense data at the required product level, but published accounts can serve as a benchmark or alternative when that is not available.

In summary, while internal data remains the most relevant source for pricing, external data from industry schemes and published competitor information provides an indispensable resource for benchmarking, filling data gaps, and developing rates for new products. However, the actuary must always apply professional judgement to assess the relevance and limitations of this data before incorporating it into a pricing analysis.
