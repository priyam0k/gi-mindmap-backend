As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note on **Reopened Claims**, positioning this concept within the larger framework of **Claim Characteristics**, a key feature of any general insurance product. For your SP8 and SP7 exams, understanding reopened claims is important because they introduce an additional layer of uncertainty into the claims development process and must be handled correctly in reserving and pricing data \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

### **The Larger Context: Key Product Features and Claim Characteristics**

When analysing a general insurance product, one of the six fundamental features we examine is its **Claim Characteristics** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This feature describes the ways in which, and the speed with which, claims originate, are reported, are settled, and, crucially, are sometimes reopened \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. The possibility of a claim being reopened after it was thought to be settled is a distinct characteristic of general insurance that contributes to the uncertainty in estimating ultimate liabilities \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **1\. Defining a Reopened Claim**

A **reopened claim** is a claim that the insurer had previously treated as fully settled but which subsequently requires further payments \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. While it is a feature of many classes of business, it is more prevalent in long-tail classes where the final outcome of a claim may not be known for many years \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

Several circumstances can lead to a claim being reopened:

* **Premature Closure of the Claim File**: This may be the result of the specific claim closure definition used by the insurer \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. Some insurers may close a file as soon as the last expected payment is made, while others conduct periodic reviews to formally close files \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
* **Emergence of Further Liability**: A new liability for payment might come to light after the claim was initially thought to be settled. This could be for additional indemnity costs or for other related expenses like legal fees \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Recovery from a Third Party**: An insurer might reopen a claim file to process a recovery made against another party involved in the original incident, through subrogation for example \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Claim by a Minor**: In some legal jurisdictions, a claim made by a minor can be reclaimed when that individual reaches the age of majority (e.g., 18\) \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Administrative Error**: The claim may have been closed in error originally \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **2\. Implications for Reserving and Actuarial Investigations**

The existence of reopened claims has significant implications for how actuaries handle claims data and project ultimate liabilities.

#### **2.1 Impact on Data Systems and Recording**

It is critical that an insurer's data system is capable of correctly identifying reopened claims and distinguishing them from new claims \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. If a reopened claim is incorrectly recorded as a new claim, this will distort the data by:

* **Inflating Claim Frequency**: The recorded number of claims will be artificially high \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Distorting Allocation by Origin Year**: The payment will be incorrectly allocated to the current year instead of the original accident or underwriting year, distorting claims development patterns \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

To prevent this, the system should retain the original claim reference number and ensure that any further payments are allocated back to the original claim cohort \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. It is also useful to record the original date of closure to allow for analysis of how frequently claims are reopened and the average time lag to reopening \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

#### **2.2 Provision in Technical Reserves**

Insurers must hold reserves to cover all expected future claim payments. The potential for reopened claims means that an explicit or implicit provision must be made for them within the technical reserves \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. The sources describe a **Reserve for reopened claims** as one of the potential components of the overall outstanding claims reserve, alongside provisions for reported claims and IBNR \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

In practice, this reserve is often not held as a separate, explicitly identified component. Instead, it may be implicitly included within the overall provision for outstanding claims, particularly if the statistical projection methods used are based on historical data that includes the effect of reopened claims \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

#### **2.3 Impact on Projection Methods**

Actuarial reserving methods that project future claims development based on historical patterns will implicitly allow for reopened claims, provided that the historical data includes them and they have been consistently recorded \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. For example, if projecting claims using an accident year cohort, any payments on reopened claims will be allocated back to the original accident year in which they occurred. A projection of the future development of these claims will therefore automatically allow for reopenings \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

However, changes in the insurer's claims handling procedures, such as a change in the definition of when a claim is "closed," can distort historical development patterns and invalidate the assumptions behind projection methods \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. Actuaries must investigate and, if necessary, adjust for such changes to ensure the reliability of their reserve estimates.
