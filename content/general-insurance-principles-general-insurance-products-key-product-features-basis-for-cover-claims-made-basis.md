As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note sequence on the **Claims-Made Basis**, positioning it as a fundamental concept within the broader context of a product's **Basis for Cover**. This is a critical distinction for SP8 and SP7, as the basis of cover dictates *when* a policy responds to a claim and fundamentally alters the long-tail risk profile for an insurer \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **The Larger Context: Basis for Cover as a Key Product Feature**

When we analyse any general insurance product, we break it down into six fundamental features to understand the risks involved \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The **Basis for Cover** is one of these six core components:

1. Benefits Provided  
2. Insured Perils  
3. **Basis for Cover**  
4. Measures of Exposure  
5. Claim Characteristics  
6. Risk and Rating Factors

The Basis for Cover is a crucial legal and technical feature defined in the **Policy Document**. It specifies the temporal trigger for a policy's response, with the two primary bases being **Losses-Occurring** and **Claims-Made** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **1\. Defining the Claims-Made Basis**

**A claims-made policy covers all claims *reported* to an insurer within the policy period, irrespective of when the loss event occurred** \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **How it Works**: If a policy runs from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, it will cover any valid claims notified to the insurer during that year \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The event causing the claim could have happened in 2023, 2022, or many years prior, as long as it falls after any specified **retroactive date** \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Historical Context**: The claims-made basis was developed partly as a response to the problems insurers faced with latent claims (e.g., asbestos) under traditional losses-occurring policies \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **2\. Risks and Implications for the Insurer**

The main advantage of a claims-made basis is the significant reduction in long-tail risk for the insurer, which provides greater certainty \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Reduced Tail Risk**: The claims-made basis effectively removes the "pure IBNR" (Incurred But Not Reported) risk for the insurer \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. Any claims from past events that are reported *after* the policy period has expired will fall on subsequent policies, not the original one that was in force when the event occurred \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This makes the business much more manageable from the insurer's perspective \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Remaining IBNER Risk**: While pure IBNR is reduced, the insurer is still exposed to IBNER (Incurred But Not Enough Reported) risk. The value of claims *reported* during the year may still develop and increase over time \[SP752.pdf\].  
* **Discovery Period / Sunset Clause**: To manage the risk of very old events being claimed, a claims-made policy may include a **discovery period** (often defined in a **sunset clause**) \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. This clause places a time limit that prevents claims from being made many years after the event that caused them \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

### **3\. Implications for the Policyholder**

While beneficial for the insurer, the claims-made basis can be less satisfactory from the policyholder's point of view.

* **Potential Gaps in Cover**: The cover granted may be unsatisfactory as it can create challenges in securing continuous cover, especially if latent claims begin to emerge \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. For example, if an employer knows that its workers have been exposed to hazardous conditions, future insurers will be very reluctant to offer affordable or comprehensive cover, knowing that claims are likely to be reported during the new policy period \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **4\. Common Product Applications**

The claims-made basis has become the standard for many long-tail liability classes where the event date can be ambiguous or where there is a high potential for latent claims \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. Common examples include:

* **Professional Indemnity (PI) / Errors & Omissions (E\&O)** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]  
* **Directors’ & Officers’ (D\&O) Liability** (sometimes called management liability insurance) \[SP7.pdf, SP3628.pdf, SP8.pdf\]  
* **Product Liability** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]  
* **Employment Practices Liability (EPL)** \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, SP8 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\]  
* **Environmental Liability** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]

### **5\. Contrast with Losses-Occurring Basis**

Understanding the claims-made basis is best reinforced by a direct comparison with the losses-occurring basis.

| Feature | Claims-Made Basis | Losses-Occurring Basis |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Trigger Event** | Claim must be **reported** during the policy period \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. | Loss event must **occur** during the policy period \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. |
| **IBNR Risk for Insurer** | Low "pure IBNR" risk. Provides greater certainty for the insurer \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. | High IBNR risk, especially for latent claims. Creates substantial uncertainty \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. |
| **Risk for Policyholder** | Can be unsatisfactory. It may be difficult to secure continuous cover if latent claims emerge \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. | Provides more comprehensive cover, as there are no gaps if the insurer is changed \[SP752.pdf\]. |
| **Typical Products** | Professional Indemnity, D\&O, Product Liability, EPL \[SP7.pdf, SP3628.pdf, SP437.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. | Motor Third Party Liability, Public Liability, UK Employers’ Liability, Property Damage \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. |

For your exams, being able to articulate these differences and their impact on risk, data requirements, and pricing/reserving assumptions is a core application skill.
