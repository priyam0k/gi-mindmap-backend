As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, I can confirm that **Climate and Environmental Factors** represent a fundamental category of external influence that must be rigorously addressed in pricing, reserving, and capital management (Syllabus Objective 1.3). These factors are highly unpredictable and introduce significant long-term volatility into the general business environment.

## **Climate and Environmental Factors in the General Business Environment**

The natural environment is a pervasive source of claims, including some of the most spectacular losses faced by insurers. The unpredictability of normal weather trends and extreme events means weather-related losses are inherently uncertain from year to year.

### **I. Physical Risks Stemming from Weather and Climate Change**

The climate factor includes both observable seasonal variations and long-term changes driven by global warming.

#### **1\. General Weather and Seasonal Effects**

* **Seasonality:** The most obvious variation is seasonality (e.g., winter vs. summer patterns), which affects claim patterns and varies by country based on differing weather patterns and local building codes.  
* **Subsidence and Heave:** The problems of subsidence and land heave are generally more likely to occur in the summer, particularly during **hot, dry periods**. The shrinkage of land leads to structural damage claims, especially for domestic property, many of which can be large. Since the damage occurs gradually, catastrophe Excess of Loss (XL) reinsurance may not respond to these losses.  
* **Location Risk:** The vulnerability of specific properties to weather events often varies in ways that are not always obvious, making underwriting difficult for mass products. Insurers address this by requesting more precise location details (e.g., full postal code) to reflect risk differences, such as proximity to floodplains or exposed areas.

#### **2\. Global Warming and Climate Change**

* **Definition and Source:** Climate change refers to long-term changes in average weather patterns, linked by scientific consensus to the rise in average global temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.  
* **Increased Hazard:** Climate change is expected to result in **increased intensity and frequency** of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, flooding, and tropical cyclones (hurricanes/typhoons). Warmer seas may lead to larger and more powerful hurricanes.  
* **Actuarial Challenge:** Climate change will be an increasing source of risk and uncertainty. This severely impacts the reliability of historical data, as past occurrence patterns for weather-related claims may no longer be appropriate. Using historical data to calibrate models may mean the model reflects a climate that is significantly out of date (e.g., 15 years out of date using 30 years of data). The effect on insurance is unclear, though even small changes may have a disproportionate effect on losses.

### **II. Emerging Risks from Climate Change Mitigation**

Beyond the direct physical damage, efforts to mitigate climate change introduce **transition and liability risks** that are critical for insurers.

1. **Transition Risks:** These are associated with society’s shift towards a low-carbon economy.  
   * **Asset Risk:** Government policies aimed at reducing global warming might reduce the value of assets held by an insurer, such as holdings in fossil fuel companies. Insurers face pressure to withdraw support from fossil fuel sectors.  
   * **Underwriting Risk:** Changes arise in commercial risks due to the adoption of sustainable manufacturing processes, or increased product liability risks from new technologies like high-energy storage batteries (due to overheating/explosion risk).  
2. **Liability Risks:** These are compensation claims for losses due to physical or transition risks.  
   * **D\&O Claims:** Litigation may emerge against policyholders (e.g., corporate directors) for failing to mitigate, adapt, and disclose the climate risks they faced.

### **III. Other Environmental Factors**

The environmental landscape includes human-made perils that introduce latent, long-tail liabilities.

1. **Human-Made Catastrophes:** These consist mainly of terrorist incidents, industrial accidents, and conflagrations. Examples include the Buncefield oil depot explosion or the World Trade Centre attacks.  
2. **Latent Claims:** These result from a cause the insurer was unaware of when writing the policy, with the potential for claims to be made many years later.  
   * **Examples:** Pollution, where exposure may last years and effects may not be apparent for many years; health hazards (e.g., from drugs causing unexpected damage); exposure to electromagnetic fields; and guns (in the US, attempted claims against manufacturers). Asbestos is considered a specific, large health hazard.

### **IV. Implications for Insurer Strategy and Financial Planning**

Environmental and climate factors significantly influence pricing, risk aggregation, and market capacity.

* **Insurability and Cost:** Increased hazards lead to increased claim costs and may affect the **insurability** of certain types of risks or regions. For instance, rising sea levels and flood risk may render some coastal areas uninsurable.  
* **Dependencies and Correlations:** Climate risk introduces dependencies or 'ripple effects' across different risk types and classes. For example, a single flood event can trigger business continuity and supply chain risks, and extreme weather can cause changes in economic activity, linking **insurance risk and market risk**.  
* **Political Difficulties:** If insurers fully reflect the true risk in premiums (e.g., for flood damage), it can cause political difficulties. Governments may feel a moral obligation to protect policyholders, potentially leading to state-administered schemes or pooling arrangements (e.g., Flood Re in the UK, funded by a levy on all insurers).  
* **Risk Management Response:** Since general insurance is primarily an annual contract, companies can adapt gradually. Short-term measures include increasing premiums (overall or for specific risks), changing benefits (excluding specific perils), strengthening underwriting controls, or revising the target market.  
* **Reinsurance Availability:** Climate change risks are expected to alter reinsurance markets. Reinsurers may increase rates and place **caps on exposures** from particular perils or regions, potentially diminishing a primary insurer’s underwriting capacity.
