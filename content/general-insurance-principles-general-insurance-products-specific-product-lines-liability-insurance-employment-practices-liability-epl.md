Based on the provided sources, let's construct a detailed note on **Employment Practices Liability (EPL)**, placing it within the broader context of **Liability Insurance**. This is a specialised product line that demonstrates the evolving nature of liability risks for companies.

### **Specific Product Lines: Liability Insurance**

#### **ðŸ”¸ Employment Practices Liability (EPL)**

Employment Practices Liability (EPL) insurance is a specialised form of liability cover that indemnifies a company and its directors against the financial consequences of employment-related claims. It is considered a form of Directors' and Officers' (D\&O) liability insurance, sometimes referred to as management liability insurance, but it specifically covers risks relating to employment practices rather than the broader performance and duties of management. While it can be considered alongside D\&O insurance, it is now more commonly sold as a standalone product.

##### **1\. Customer Need and Benefits**

The primary customer need is to protect companies and their directors from the liabilities associated with legal costs and subsequent awards for defending employment-related claims. As legal and social environments evolve, the risks associated with employment practices (such as claims of unfair dismissal or discrimination) have become more significant, creating a specific need for this type of cover. The policy benefits are an indemnity against both the legal defence costs and any potential settlement awards.

##### **2\. Insured Perils**

EPL policies are designed to cover a range of "wrongful acts" committed by a company or its management in their capacity as employers. The sources list several key perils that would be covered:

* **Unfair dismissal** of an employee.  
* **Constructive dismissal**, where an employee resigns due to the employer's conduct.  
* **Discrimination** against an employee, for example, being overlooked for promotion or paid less for an equivalent job.  
* Failure to correctly follow **misconduct procedures** when dismissing an employee.  
* Failure to comply with **working hours legislation**.  
* **Wrongful demotion** of an employee.  
* Other modern perils such as claims arising from **sexual harassment**, which have gained prominence with movements like \#MeToo, can also fall under this type of cover.

##### **3\. Claim Characteristics**

Like most specialised liability lines, EPL has distinct claim characteristics that are important for pricing and reserving.

* **Basis of Cover**: EPL is almost always written on a **claims-made basis**. This means the policy covers claims that are *reported* during the policy period, regardless of when the wrongful act occurred. This is a common feature for long-tail liability lines as it helps the insurer reduce uncertainty by shortening the reporting tail.  
* **Long Tail**: EPL is a **long-tail** class of business. Claims can be complex and may involve lengthy legal disputes before a final settlement is reached.  
* **External Influences**: The cost and frequency of EPL claims are heavily influenced by the external environment. The sources highlight that it is important to consider the **current legal environment** and the **specific industry being covered**, as these factors have a material impact on claim costs. The inflationary trends for EPL also tend to differ from those for general D\&O policies.

##### **4\. Pricing and Underwriting**

* **Individual Underwriting**: Due to the specialised nature of the risks, EPL policies are typically **underwritten individually**.  
* **Risk/Rating Factors**: The underwriter's assessment will be based on the specific risk profile of the company. Key risk factors include:  
  * The nature of the company and its industry.  
  * The company's past claims experience.  
  * The prevailing legal environment, which can significantly alter the risk of claims being brought and the potential size of awards.
