As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed, structured note on **Proportional Reinsurance**. This is a foundational topic within the broader syllabus area of "Types of Reinsurance Products" and is critical for both SP8 (Pricing) and SP7 (Reserving and Capital Modelling) \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. A strong grasp of the mechanics, advantages, and disadvantages of proportional reinsurance is essential for exam success.

### **Types of Reinsurance Products**

Traditional reinsurance products are divided into two fundamental categories based on how premiums and losses are shared between the ceding insurer (the cedant) and the reinsurer \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. These categories are:

1. **Proportional Reinsurance**: The cedant and reinsurer share premiums and losses in an agreed-upon proportion \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
2. **Non-Proportional Reinsurance**: The reinsurer's liability is triggered only when the cedant's loss exceeds a pre-agreed retention or "excess point" \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

This note will focus on the first category: Proportional Reinsurance.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Proportional Reinsurance**

**Definition**: Under proportional reinsurance, the insurer (cedant) and the reinsurer share the premiums and losses for each risk according to a pre-agreed proportion \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This method reduces the size of the ceding insurer's net account and can be a means of accepting a larger size of risk than would otherwise be possible \[SP7.pdf\].

A key financial feature of proportional reinsurance is the **ceding commission**, which is a payment made by the reinsurer to the cedant \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. This commission serves to reimburse the direct writer for some of the initial expenses incurred in selling the original policies (acquisition costs) and administering the business \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. It can also be a significant source of financial assistance for the cedant \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

There are two main types of proportional reinsurance:

1. Quota Share Reinsurance  
2. Surplus Reinsurance

##### **ðŸ”¸ 1\. Quota Share Reinsurance**

**Definition**: This is the simplest form of proportional reinsurance \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. The insurer cedes a fixed percentage of every risk within the scope of the treaty, and the reinsurer accepts that same percentage of premiums and any subsequent losses \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Mechanism**: If a 40% quota share treaty is in place, the reinsurer receives 40% of the premium and pays 40% of every claim on every policy covered by the treaty \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Purpose**: It is highly effective for increasing underwriting capacity and directly improving the solvency ratio by reducing net written premiums \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. It can also be used to facilitate reciprocal arrangements with other insurers to spread risk \[SP7.pdf\]. An insurer might also use it when entering a new market or product line to leverage the reinsurer's expertise \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Advantages**:  
  * **Administratively Simple**: A straight percentage calculation is applied to totals, requiring minimal detailed record-keeping for each individual risk \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * **Effective for Capital Relief**: It directly reduces net written premiums and liabilities, which are key metrics in many regulatory capital calculations, thus improving the solvency margin \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Disadvantages**:  
  * **Inflexible**: It cedes the same proportion of *every* risk, regardless of its size or profitability. This means the insurer gives away a share of its most profitable business alongside its less profitable business \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * **Inefficient for Managing Volatility**: It does not specifically target large or catastrophic losses. The insurer still retains its fixed percentage of even the largest claims \[Reinsurance.pdf\].

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2\. Surplus Reinsurance**

**Definition**: Surplus reinsurance offers more flexibility than quota share. The insurer establishes a "retention" or "line," which is the maximum amount of a risk it wishes to retain for its own account (e.g., Â£200,000). For any policy with a Sum Insured or Estimated Maximum Loss (EML) greater than this retention, the surplus is ceded to the reinsurer \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Mechanism**: If an insurer's retention is Â£200,000 and it insures a property with an EML of Â£1,000,000, it retains 20% (Â£200k) of the risk and cedes the 80% surplus (Â£800k). Premiums and losses for that specific policy are then shared in that 20:80 ratio. Any risk with an EML below the retention (e.g., Â£150,000) is retained 100% by the insurer \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Purpose**: This form is highly suitable for property classes like commercial fire, where risk sizes can vary widely. It allows the insurer to retain smaller, more predictable risks in full while ceding a larger proportion of bigger, more volatile risks, thereby achieving a more balanced net portfolio \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Advantages**:  
  * **Flexibility**: The insurer can choose its retention level for each risk (up to a treaty maximum), allowing it to keep more of its profitable business while protecting itself on larger exposures \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * **Efficient Risk Management**: It specifically targets larger risks, which is a more efficient way of managing portfolio volatility compared to a quota share arrangement \[Reinsurance.pdf\].  
* **Disadvantages**:  
  * **Administratively Complex**: It requires the insurer to assess and record the retention and cession for each individual risk, which is more work than a simple quota share \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * **Unsuitable for certain lines**: It is unsuitable for liability classes where there is no effective limit or sum insured, making it impossible to determine the surplus to be ceded \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

#### **Exam Coach Tip:**

When asked to discuss proportional reinsurance, start with the core principle: the sharing of premiums and losses in an agreed proportion, and always mention the role of the ceding commission \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

A strong exam answer will clearly differentiate between **Quota Share** and **Surplus**.

* **Quota Share** is simple and inflexible. Think of it as a blunt tool, best used for broad strategic goals like increasing overall capacity, gaining financial assistance, or getting expertise for a new, undifferentiated portfolio of business \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Surplus** is flexible and targeted. Think of it as a sharper tool, best used to manage a portfolio with varying risk sizes, like commercial property. It allows the insurer to retain more of the smaller, profitable risks and cede the larger, more volatile ones \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

Be prepared to recommend one type over the other in a given scenario. For example, a new insurer with limited capital starting in a new market would likely benefit from a Quota Share treaty for its simplicity, capital relief, and access to reinsurer expertise. An established property insurer, on the other hand, would find a Surplus treaty more efficient for managing its diverse portfolio of risk sizes.
