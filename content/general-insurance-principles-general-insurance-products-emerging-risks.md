As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a comprehensive note on **Emerging Risks**, a critical topic within the general business environment that significantly impacts product design, pricing, and capital management. Understanding how insurers identify, assess, and manage these risks is a key higher-order skill tested in the Specialist Principles and Advanced exams.

### **The General Business Environment: Emerging Risks**

An emerging risk is defined as a risk that is not yet well understood or prominent, and for which current risk management techniques may be less appropriate over time. These risks pose a significant threat to an insurer's profitability and solvency because they are not typically accounted for in pricing or reserving models based on historical data. The sources highlight that the emergence of new risks is a major area of uncertainty for general insurers.

##### **1\. The Nature and Challenge of Emerging Risks**

Emerging risks are challenging because of the significant uncertainty surrounding them. This uncertainty arises from several factors:

* **Identification:** The risk's very existence may not yet be known (the "unknown" stage).  
* **Impact Assessment:** The potential impact of the risk is not yet understood (the "potential" stage).  
* **Quantification:** It is not yet possible to accurately and reliably quantify the risk's frequency or severity.  
* **Changing Nature:** A previously well-understood risk may be changing in ways that make historical understanding inappropriate (e.g., climate change).

The primary challenge for insurers is the **almost total lack of historical data** to understand and model the risk, making traditional actuarial techniques difficult to apply.

##### **2\. Examples of Emerging and Latent Risks**

The sources provide numerous examples, which often overlap with the concept of **latent claims**â€”claims arising from perils unforeseen when the policy was written and which become known many years after the cause of loss. These serve as case studies for the potential impact of emerging risks.

**ðŸ”¸ 2.1 Cyber Risk** Cyber risk is a relatively new and rapidly developing product area that has emerged in response to technological change. It is a prime example of an emerging risk that insurers are now trying to explicitly cover.

* **Customer Need:** Protects businesses from losses due to data breaches or cyber attacks, covering costs like incident management, system rebuilds, business interruption, legal fees, and ransom demands.  
* **Risk Characteristics:** It has massive **accumulation potential**. A significant challenge is "silent cyber"â€”where losses from a cyber event are covered under a traditional policy (e.g., property, business interruption) that does not explicitly mention cyber.  
* **Pricing/Underwriting:** Due to its evolving nature, policies are individually underwritten, considering factors like IT maturity, dependence on IT, and the nature of customer data held.

**ðŸ”¸ 2.2 Climate Change** Climate change is a critical emerging risk, fundamentally altering the risk landscape for insurers. It acts as a common driver that can affect multiple lines of business simultaneously, potentially increasing correlations between previously independent risks.

* **Risk Types:** It presents three categories of risk to insurers:  
  1. **Physical Risks:** Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (heatwaves, floods, tropical cyclones) leading to higher property and business interruption claims.  
  2. **Transition Risks:** Risks associated with the shift to a low-carbon economy, which could devalue assets (e.g., investments in fossil fuel companies).  
  3. **Liability Risks:** Litigation against policyholders for failing to mitigate, adapt to, or disclose climate risks, impacting classes like Directors' and Officers' (D\&O) liability.  
* **Impact on Models:** Historical weather data becomes less relevant for predicting future claims, increasing uncertainty in pricing and capital models.

**ðŸ”¸ 2.3 Other Potential Emerging Risks** The sources list many other areas where latent claims have emerged or could emerge in the future, serving as a reminder of the broad scope of this challenge:

* **Technological:** Nanotechnology (used in sunscreens, etc.), electromagnetic fields, mobile phones, autonomous cars.  
* **Health & Lifestyle:** Opioid addiction crisis, implications of vaping, lifestyle risks like obesity and alcoholism.  
* **Social & Legal:** The \#MeToo movement and claims related to sexual harassment or historical abuse have emerged as significant sources of liability claims.

##### **3\. Insurer Response to Emerging Risks**

**ðŸ”¸ 3.1 Identification and Exposure Management** Given the lack of data, insurers must rely on non-traditional methods to identify and assess emerging risks:

* **Identification Techniques:** Methods include brainstorming sessions with employees and consultants, "what-if" analysis of historical loss events, and reviewing process flowcharts to spot previously unnoticed vulnerabilities.  
* **Exposure Assessment:** Since frequency and severity are hard to quantify from historical data, insurers often rely on **expert judgement**. A high-level approach might classify risks by low/medium/high frequency and severity to prioritise further investigation.  
* **Exposure Control:** Due to the high uncertainty, crude but necessary exposure management tools are often used, such as refusing to write the business altogether or strictly limiting the total sum insured to a manageable level.

**ðŸ”¸ 3.2 Product Development and Pricing** Emerging risks directly impact product development and underwriting:

* **Coverage Restrictions:** The standard response is to refuse cover through **exclusion clauses**. Policy wordings are critical and insurers must know the jurisdictions they are exposed to.  
* **Under-supply:** This cautious approach often leads to an under-supply of relevant insurance relative to demand, which can push up prices for the limited cover that is available.  
* **Pricing Challenges:** The lack of historical data makes traditional pricing very difficult. Pricing relies heavily on judgement and may incorporate significant contingency loadings to reflect the high uncertainty.

**ðŸ”¸ 3.3 Capital Modelling** Emerging risks, particularly those not reflected in historical data (**Events Not In Data or ENIDs**), must be considered in capital modelling. A capital model that relies solely on past data will underestimate variability and capital requirements. Insurers may need to increase the standard deviation of loss distributions beyond what historical data suggests or model explicit shocks to allow for these risks.

*Exam Coach Tip: Questions on emerging risks test your ability to think beyond standard actuarial models and consider the broader business and risk environment. A strong answer will define emerging risks, provide diverse examples like cyber, climate change, and nanotechnology, and explain why traditional data-driven methods fail. Crucially, you must discuss the insurer's response: identification through expert judgement, management through exclusions and strict limits, and the challenges for pricing and capital. Connecting this to the concept of ENIDs in capital modelling and latent claims in reserving will show a holistic understanding across the GI actuarial specialisms.*
