Alright, future actuarial leader\! Let's dive deep into a critical aspect of general insurance reserving: the **Analysis of Emerging Experience** and its role within those essential **Reasonableness Checks**. As your SP7 Exam Coach, I want you to grasp not just *what* these are, but *why* they are fundamental to robust actuarial practice and how you can articulate them clearly in your exams.

### **Analysis of Emerging Experience in the Context of Reasonableness Checks for Reserving**

In the demanding world of General Insurance reserving, we are constantly striving for the most accurate reflection of an insurer's liabilities. Our point estimates, or 'best estimates', are crucial, but they are just that – estimates. The real magic, and the real challenge, lies in understanding the inherent uncertainty and ensuring our numbers hold up against the ever-unfolding reality. This is precisely where reasonableness checks, and particularly the analysis of emerging experience, come into play.

#### **1\. The Purpose and Importance of Reasonableness Checks**

First, let's establish why we bother with reasonableness checks. A diagnostic is defined as a measure used to assist with the interpretation of data or results and to help us test and verify the underlying methodology and assumptions. These checks are not mere formalities; they are the bedrock of sound actuarial practice.

The core reasons for conducting these assessments are:

* **Validity and Justification:** To ensure that the calculated reserves are justifiable and that the methodology and assumptions adopted are appropriate.  
* **Support by Emerging Experience:** To confirm that new results are supported by the latest observable experience. This often involves an "Actual versus Expected" exercise, comparing actual experience in a period since the last review with what was anticipated.  
* **Maintaining Relevance:** The general insurance environment is dynamic. Monitoring emerging experience helps us understand the effect of past actions, revise our risk management strategy, and reassess the risks faced by the firm.  
* **Preventing Anchoring:** There's a significant danger of "anchoring" – relying too heavily on past estimates even when new trends emerge, which can lead to results gradually ceasing to be reasonable. Reasonableness checks help us avoid this pitfall.  
* **Identifying Limitations:** Diagnostics can highlight inconsistencies in model assumptions, errors in the reserving process, or unexpected emerging experience that might require changes to our methodology or assumptions.  
* **Informing Stakeholders:** Ultimately, the findings must be communicated effectively to senior management, the board, and regulators, ensuring they understand the reliability and adequacy of the technical provisions.

As an Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, I must stress that this whole process is an embodiment of the **actuarial control cycle** – a continuous loop of setting assumptions, monitoring experience, analysing deviations, and feeding back adjustments.

#### **2\. Analysis of Emerging Experience: A Core Component**

The analysis of emerging experience is a critical part of assessing the reasonableness of reserving results. It provides vital feedback by comparing what was expected to happen with what actually did. This analysis allows actuaries to understand the drivers of change in reserve estimates over time.

The movement in the estimated ultimate claims (the final cost when all claims in a cohort have been settled) since the previous review can be broken down into several component parts for clear understanding and communication:

* **Emerging Experience vs. Expected (under the previous model):** This is where we quantify how much of the change is simply due to the actual experience deviating from the prior expectations. It requires the actuarial model to have predictive capability. For example, the difference between actual and expected movement in incurred claims, or the "IBNR burn rate" for short-tail classes.  
* **Changes in Methodology:** Sometimes, changes in reserve estimates are a result of adopting a new reserving method. While appropriate in certain circumstances, this can make communicating results more challenging, as it's not due to a change in underlying experience.  
* **Changes in Assumptions:** Alterations to key assumptions (e.g., inflation rates, development patterns, loss ratios) will directly impact reserve estimates. This component isolates the effect of these specific actuarial judgments.

This granular breakdown aids in understanding which factors are most significant and have had the greatest influence on the changes.

#### **3\. Key Factors and Diagnostics in the Analysis**

When performing the analysis of emerging experience, we scrutinize various aspects of the data and environment. Here's a breakdown of what we look for:

##### **3.1. Trends in Claims Experience**

* **Frequency and Severity:** It's often useful to split the effects of **claim frequency** (number of claims per unit exposure) and **claim severity** (average cost per claim). Different influences impact these separately, and models are often constructed to allow for distinct trends in each. For instance, a rise in overall claims could be due to more claims (frequency) or larger claims (severity), and this analysis helps pinpoint the true driver.  
* **Inflation:** Allowance for future inflation is paramount. We must consider **claims inflation** (e.g., court award inflation, medical costs, wage inflation) which can exceed general price inflation, and distinguish between inflation by origin year or calendar year. Unexpected inflation trends necessitate re-evaluation of assumptions or methods.  
* **Socio-economic Trends:** Changes in the legal, demographic, medical, technological, social, or economic environment (e.g., increased litigiousness, new legislation like seatbelt laws, or economic recession) can cause discontinuities in claims experience. We must incorporate these, perhaps by adjusting historical data or selecting different methods.

##### **3.2. Impact of Large Claims and Exceptional Items**

* **Large and Catastrophe Claims:** These claims have different frequency and severity distributions and development patterns compared to attritional (normal, non-large) claims. They are often removed from aggregate data and projected separately to avoid distorting overall experience. Analysis helps determine drivers, specific areas prone to them, and appropriate reinsurance needs. Catastrophe models are often employed for such infrequent, extreme events, recognizing that historical data may be insufficient.  
* **Events Not In Data (ENIDs):** Consideration is given to claim types not present in historical data. We might need to increase standard deviations or model these separately.  
* **Latent Claims:** These are unique due to their long reporting lags and uncertain ultimate liability (e.g., asbestos, pollution, health hazards). They require specific, often subjective, modelling approaches due to limited historical data and evolving understanding. Expert judgment, brainstorming, and what-if scenarios are crucial here.

##### **3.3. Changes in Business and Operational Aspects**

* **Mix of Business:** Planned or unplanned changes in the mix of business significantly impact claims characteristics (frequency, severity, volatility, timing of payments) and increase uncertainty. This requires careful consideration when selecting development patterns.  
* **New Markets/Distribution Channels:** Entering new markets or using new distribution channels introduces unpredictable expenses and can alter claims frequency, severity, and development patterns.  
* **Claims Handling Procedures:** Changes in claims processing, assessment, or handling (e.g., speeding up processes, backlog clear-outs, or changes in case reserving philosophy) directly distort claims development patterns. Collaboration with the claims department is essential to understand these impacts.  
* **"Watchlists" and Monitored Claims:** The reserving actuary should discuss claims under close monitoring (watchlists) with the claims team, especially for long-tailed classes where case reserves may not be representative of likely costs. This informs adjustments to IBNR projections.

##### **3.4. Underwriting Cycle and Reserving Cycle**

* **Underwriting Cycle:** The analysis must account for the underwriting cycle, which influences premium rates and can be correlated with investment markets. This can be allowed for by using rate indices when deriving initial expected loss ratios for methods like Bornhuetter-Ferguson.  
* **Reserving Cycle:** Evidence suggests a "reserving cycle" highly correlated with the underwriting cycle, where booked reserves may be over- or underestimated. This often means longer development patterns in a soft market. While the Board makes decisions on booked reserves, the actuary's best estimate should remain objective, though a range can be provided. Flattening the reserving cycle through accurate reserves reduces adverse impacts on ongoing business and improves profitability understanding.

##### **3.5. Comparative Diagnostics**

Various diagnostic ratios are employed to provide a high-level "reasonableness" check and indicate areas needing closer examination:

* **Loss Ratios:** Reviewing changes in paid, outstanding, IBNR, incurred, and ultimate loss ratios can indicate changes in premium rating strength, sources of uncertainty, inconsistencies in model assumptions, or errors in the reserving process.  
* **Paid-to-Incurred / Case Estimates-to-Incurred Ratios:** These indicate the strength of case estimates. An increasing ratio of paid to incurred claims might suggest reduced case estimate strength.  
* **Average Outstanding Case Estimate:** A review can highlight changes in the strength of case reserves.  
* **IBNR to Case Estimates:** Useful for more mature cohorts where IBNR is primarily IBNER (Incurred But Not Enough Reported).  
* **Survival Ratios:** Show how long a reserve or IBNR estimate will last if current paid/incurred claims development continues.  
* **Claim Frequency and Average Cost per Claim:** Useful when claim count information is available, identifying inflationary trends and frequency trends per unit of exposure.  
* **Reinsurance to Gross Ratios:** Analyzing these ratios (gross, reinsurance, net) helps understand the interaction between them, especially considering changes in reinsurance programs, policy terms, or underlying gross experience.  
* **Development Pattern Diagnostics:** Comparing assumed future development patterns with past ones, often using cumulative claims as a proportion of estimated ultimate claims, helps assess consistency across origin years. Deviations can signal external influences, internal changes, or random fluctuations.  
* **Residuals of Fitted Link Ratios:** Analyzing the size and pattern of residuals on individually fitted link ratios can identify distortions in underlying data or suggest the estimate is uncertain or inappropriate.

#### **4\. The Role of Actuarial Judgement and Professional Issues**

It is critical that actuaries apply considerable **judgement** throughout this process. No mechanical application of a model, especially a stochastic one, can replace the need for professional insight. Judgement is needed to:

* Select appropriate methods given data limitations.  
* Determine the reasonableness of results.  
* Interpret diagnostics and understand underlying reasons for trends.  
* Adjust for unusual features or changes in the environment.  
* Balance reliance on historical data versus forward-looking assumptions.

**Professional issues** can arise, particularly when dealing with alternative estimates that may be influenced by financial interests (e.g., underwriters' bonuses linked to reserves). Actuaries must maintain independence and ensure their opinions are objective, even when differing from management or regulators.

#### **5\. Communicating the Findings**

Communicating the results of the reserving exercise, including the uncertainties and the analysis of emerging experience, is paramount. The communication should:

* **Clarify Definitions:** Ensure consistent vocabulary and explain terms, especially regarding uncertainty (e.g., process, parameter, model uncertainty).  
* **Focus on Significance:** Emphasize the most significant issues, given the purpose and scope of the exercise.  
* **Transparency:** Clearly state material assumptions, their rationale, and any significant limitations of models or data.  
* **Quantify Uncertainty:** Provide sensitivities, ranges of possible outcomes (e.g., range of best estimates, probable outcomes), and likelihoods where appropriate.  
* **Explain Deviations:** Clearly explain how actual results compare to expected and *why* any features have happened, including qualitative information from claims or administration.

**For your exam**, remember to articulate the cyclical nature of reserving and the continuous need for monitoring and adjusting. You'll often be asked to justify your chosen assumptions, and a deep understanding of emerging experience provides that justification. Think "Actuarial Control Cycle" and "Justification, Justification, Justification\!" for every step of your reasoning.

This comprehensive approach to analyzing emerging experience, underpinned by robust reasonableness checks, allows us as actuaries to provide credible, reliable, and well-understood reserve estimates for all stakeholders. Keep studying those diagnostic tools, and you'll excel\!\#\#\# Analysis of Emerging Experience in the Context of Reasonableness Checks for Reserving

As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP7, I can tell you that understanding "Analysis of Emerging Experience" within the broader framework of "Reasonableness Checks" is absolutely crucial for your success. It’s not just about crunching numbers; it’s about understanding the financial heartbeat of a general insurer and ensuring our estimates remain robust and realistic in a dynamic environment.

Let's break this down systematically, starting from the foundational principles and building up to the practicalities and communication aspects.

#### **1\. Introduction to Reasonableness Checks**

In general insurance reserving, a **diagnostic** is a vital tool. It is defined as a measure used to assist with the interpretation of data or results, helping us to test and verify the underlying methodology and assumptions. These diagnostics provide a high-level 'reasonableness' check on our reserve estimates or indicate specific areas of the portfolio that warrant deeper examination.

The ultimate goal of undertaking reasonableness checks on reserving results is multi-faceted:

* **Validation:** To ensure that the results are reasonable and justifiable.  
* **Support by Emerging Experience:** To confirm that the new reserve estimates are indeed supported by the latest experience emerging from the business.  
* **Methodology and Assumption Appropriateness:** To verify that the chosen methodologies and underlying assumptions remain suitable for the current and anticipated claims environment.  
* **Identification of Issues:** To detect any errors, inconsistencies, or unusual features in the data or the reserving process itself.  
* **Avoiding Anchoring:** A critical danger in reserving is "anchoring," where there's a tendency to rely too heavily on past estimates, even when new trends emerge. Reasonableness checks help us avoid adjusting assumptions too slowly in the face of unexpected developments.  
* **Feedback Loop for Actuarial Control Cycle:** This process is an integral part of the actuarial control cycle, allowing for continuous monitoring, comparison of actual vs. expected, and subsequent adjustment of assumptions or methodologies.

#### **2\. The Essence of Analysing Emerging Experience**

The analysis of emerging experience is the active process of monitoring how actual claims develop over time compared to what was previously expected or assumed. It's the "actual versus expected" exercise that forms the core feedback mechanism.

When analyzing changes in estimated ultimate claims over time, we typically disaggregate the movement into key components to gain a clear understanding of the drivers:

* **Comparison of Emerging Experience to Previous Model's Expectation:** This quantifies the portion of the change directly attributable to the actual run-off of claims being different from the prediction of the prior model. For this, the actuarial model must have predictive capability. For example, for the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method, this might involve assessing the difference between the actual and expected movement in incurred claims, often referred to as the "IBNR burn rate".  
* **Changes in Methodology:** This component accounts for changes in the estimated ultimate claims that arise purely from a shift in the reserving methods used. While sometimes necessary, such changes can complicate the communication of results if not clearly explained.  
* **Changes in Assumptions:** This isolates the impact of modifications to key assumptions (e.g., claims inflation rates, discount rates, development patterns, or loss ratios). This is where actuarial judgment in adjusting to new information is reflected.

This breakdown is crucial because it allows us to discern whether deviations are due to random variation, systematic changes in the underlying business, or revisions in our actuarial approach.

#### **3\. Key Factors and Diagnostics in Practice**

Let's delve into the specific factors and diagnostics we examine when performing an analysis of emerging experience:

##### **3.1. Trends in Claims Characteristics**

* **Claim Frequency and Severity:** It is highly beneficial to separate the analysis of **claim frequency** (number of claims per unit of exposure) from **claim severity** (the average cost of a claim). Different external and internal factors influence these independently. For instance, an increase in overall claims might be driven by more claims, larger claims, or both. This separation helps us pinpoint the root cause and apply more targeted adjustments.  
* **Claims Inflation:** Inflation is a major driver of claims costs. We must consider its impact on both existing and future claims. This includes various forms such as **price inflation**, **building cost inflation** (for property), **earnings inflation**, and **court award inflation** (for liability claims). We assess recent movements in relevant indices and economic forecasts to form assumptions. Methods that explicitly allow for future inflation may be preferred if inflation is no longer stable.  
* **Socio-Economic, Legal, and Political Environment:** Changes in these areas can cause significant discontinuities. Examples include stricter seatbelt laws reducing injury severity, or economic recessions increasing claims on creditor business or arson. We aim to make reasonable allowances for these, checking against emerging experience or comparable situations in other countries.

##### **3.2. Specific Claim Types and Anomalies**

* **Large and Catastrophe Claims:** These are typically modelled and analyzed separately from 'attritional' (normal) claims due to their distinct frequency and severity distributions and development patterns. Catastrophe models are often used for rare, high-impact events like earthquakes or windstorms, where an insurer's own historical data is insufficient. Analyzing these helps inform reinsurance strategy and capital requirements.  
* **Latent Claims:** Claims like asbestos-related illnesses, pollution, and health hazards (APH) are particularly challenging due to their long tail, uncertain emergence, and evolving understanding of liability. They require subjective, exposure-based methods rather than standard triangulation, often relying on expert judgment and brainstorming.  
* **Events Not In Data (ENIDs):** These are claim types not reflected in historical data that may emerge in the future. Stochastic models may need adjustment (e.g., increasing standard deviations) to account for such unobserved risks.

##### **3.3. Operational and Business Changes**

* **Mix of Business:** Any planned or unplanned changes in the composition of the business (e.g., different risk profiles, geographies) will alter the claims characteristics and increase uncertainty. This necessitates careful re-evaluation of development patterns.  
* **New Markets/Distribution Channels:** Launching into new markets or utilizing new distribution channels (e.g., online sales) introduces new expense profiles and potentially different claims frequency, severity, and development patterns due to varying policyholder behaviour.  
* **Claims Handling Procedures:** Modifications to claims assessment, processing speeds, or case reserving philosophies can significantly distort historical development patterns. Close collaboration with the claims department is vital to understand these operational shifts and their actuarial implications. This includes understanding 'watchlists' of closely monitored claims, which can inform IBNR adjustments.

##### **3.4. Economic and Underwriting Cycles**

* **Underwriting Cycle:** This is the cyclical fluctuation in premium rates and profitability within the insurance market. Reserving actuaries must account for the market's position in this cycle, as it can influence premium rates and even claims development patterns (e.g., longer development in a soft market). Using rate indices is one way to allow for this in reserving methods.  
* **Reserving Cycle:** There is also evidence of a "reserving cycle" highly correlated with the underwriting cycle, where booked reserves may be systematically over- or under-estimated. While management ultimately decides on booked reserves, the actuary's best estimate should remain objective, but they may communicate a range of reasonable outcomes.

##### **3.5. Typical Diagnostics Used**

Beyond breaking down movements, actuaries employ various diagnostic ratios and comparisons to assess reasonableness:

* **Loss Ratios:** Reviewing changes in paid, outstanding, IBNR, incurred, and ultimate loss ratios. These can highlight shifts in premium rating strength, inconsistencies, or errors.  
* **Paid-to-Incurred and Case Estimates-to-Incurred Ratios:** These indicators provide insight into the strength and consistency of case estimates over time.  
* **Average Outstanding Case Estimate:** Monitoring this helps identify changes in the prudence or realism of individual case reserves.  
* **Ratio of IBNR to Case Estimates:** Particularly useful for mature long-tailed classes, indicating the proportion of outstanding claims that are still IBNR.  
* **Survival Ratios:** These ratios, such as the three-year survival ratio for asbestos claims, estimate how long reserves will last based on current payment rates.  
* **Claim Frequency and Average Cost per Claim Diagnostics:** These are crucial when claim count data is available, helping to isolate trends in frequency versus severity.  
* **Reinsurance to Gross Ratios:** Analyzing how gross, reinsurance recoveries, and net claims estimates interact can reveal changes in reinsurance programs, policy terms, or underlying gross experience.  
* **Development Pattern Diagnostics:** Comparing assumed future development patterns against historical ones. This can reveal influences like inflation, catastrophes, changes in underwriting, or random fluctuations.  
* **Residuals of Fitted Link Ratios:** Analyzing the patterns and spread of residuals from chain ladder models can identify underlying distortions like calendar year effects (e.g., a claims processing speed-up).

#### **4\. Applying Actuarial Judgement and Professional Considerations**

It's paramount to remember that the application of actuarial judgment is never purely mechanical. It's a blend of quantitative analysis and qualitative insight. Actuaries must:

* **Exercise Professional Judgement:** When data is sparse, unreliable, or subject to significant change, judgment becomes even more critical.  
* **Seek Peer Review:** Engaging a more experienced actuary or undergoing a peer review can provide valuable challenge and enhance the robustness of methodologies and assumptions.  
* **Address Professional Issues:** Be aware of potential conflicts of interest, especially when alternative estimates are prepared by individuals with a financial stake in the outcome (e.g., underwriters). The actuary's role is to provide an objective best estimate.  
* **Consider Materiality:** Decisions on whether to update methodologies or assumptions based on unusual features identified in diagnostics often depend on the materiality of the potential change relative to the company's total reserves and the purpose of the exercise.

#### **5\. Effective Communication of Analysis**

Even the most robust analysis is useless if it cannot be effectively communicated to stakeholders such as senior management, the board, and regulators. Communication must be:

* **Clear and Concise:** Avoid jargon or explain technical terms where necessary.  
* **Purpose-Driven:** Tailor the communication to the specific purpose and audience of the reserving exercise.  
* **Transparent:** Disclose all material assumptions, their rationale, and any significant limitations of the models or data.  
* **Focused on Uncertainty:** Clearly communicate the level of uncertainty surrounding the best estimate, often by providing ranges of outcomes (e.g., best estimates, plausible outcomes, or extreme scenarios) and their associated likelihoods.  
* **Actionable:** Explain how actual results compare to expected, why deviations occurred, and the implications for future strategy and decision-making.

In essence, the analysis of emerging experience is the compass that guides us through the unpredictable seas of general insurance liabilities. It ensures that our reserve estimates are not static figures but living, breathing reflections of the evolving business and external environment. Mastering this will not only make you an exemplary actuary but also a highly effective communicator and strategic advisor in your career. Keep reviewing those diagnostics\!
