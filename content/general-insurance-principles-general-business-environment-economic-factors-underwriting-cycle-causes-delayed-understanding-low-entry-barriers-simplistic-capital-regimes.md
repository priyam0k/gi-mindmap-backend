As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, understanding the underlying drivers of the **Underwriting Cycle** is fundamental, as this macroeconomic factor dictates market pricing levels and influences strategic profitability decisions (Syllabus Objective 1.3).

The Underwriting Cycle refers to the systematic oscillation of industry-wide premium rates and overall profitability, moving between periods of high premiums and profit (Hard Market) and low premiums and competition (Soft Market),,. The sources identify several key factors that encourage and facilitate the existence and progression of this cycle,.

Here is a discussion focusing on the specified primary causes:

## **I. Delayed Understanding of Profitability**

One of the most critical factors contributing to the existence of the underwriting cycle is the **delay between writing business and knowing how profitable it is**,,.

This delay is particularly pronounced in long-tailed classes, where claims may take many years to fully emerge and settle. The time lag means that insurers often fail to realize the emergence of higher claims costs early enough, which consequently leads to the **under-pricing of current risks**,. This operational blind spot allows the market to drift into the unprofitable soft phase before corrective action is mandated by realized losses.

## **II. Low Barriers to Entry**

The structural ease with which new capital can enter the insurance market encourages the cyclical progression,.

The insurance industry generally exhibits **low barriers to entry**,. While regulatory authorization is significant, requiring demonstration of capital sufficiency and technical competence, setting up operations does not require the establishment of specialized plant and equipment or extensive resource development compared to other industries,.

This low barrier facilitates the movement of capital. When the market is in a profitable hard phase, the prospect of high returns attracts new capital, which can be subscribed to existing companies or new companies. This inflow **increases market capacity**,, leading to heightened competition and driving premium rates down, thus initiating or accelerating the move toward a soft market.

## **III. Simplistic Regulatory Capital Regimes**

Historically, the regulatory framework often inadvertently exacerbated the insurance cycle, although modern regimes aim to mitigate this effect.

**Exacerbation of the Cycle:** Simplistic capital regimes were identified as a factor encouraging the cycle's progress,. For instance, prior to 2016, the European Union's regulatory minimum capital requirement (MCR, known as Solvency I) was calculated based primarily on the volume of premium written (e.g., 16%â€“18% of annual premiums),.

**The Mismatch:** This premium-based approach meant that writing an under-priced policy required **less commitment of capital** than writing an over-priced one. This is the exact opposite of what a risk-based consideration would warrant,.

* **Soft Market:** This structure allowed companies to write more business (in terms of risk taken on) as premium rates fell,.  
* **Hard Market:** Conversely, as premium rates rose (increasing written premium), the capital requirement increased, forcing insurers to restrict the amount of risk written unless they could raise more capital. This restriction contributed to the difficulty of finding cover and tended to drive premium rates even higher,.

Current EU regulation, known as **Solvency II**, is recognized as being much more sophisticated and aims to reduce these unwanted side-effects through a risk-based approach to capital requirements,.
