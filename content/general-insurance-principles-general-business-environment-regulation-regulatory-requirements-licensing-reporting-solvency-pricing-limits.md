## **Regulatory Requirements in the General Business Environment**

Regulation of general insurers is necessary because of the fundamental nature of the insurance contract—where the policyholder pays upfront and must trust the insurer to pay future claims—meaning the insurer’s financial stability is paramount.

Regulatory requirements can be broadly divided into four areas: Licensing and Authorization, Solvency and Capital, Pricing and Underwriting Limits, and Reporting and Disclosure.

### **I. Requirements Governing Authorization and Licensing**

Regulators impose constraints on who can operate and how business is initiated, primarily to ensure competence and sound management.

1. **Restrictions on Business Type and Classes:** Authorities can impose restrictions on the specific **type of business** a general insurer can write or the **classes** for which it is authorized. This is done to prevent insurers from writing volatile classes or areas where they lack sufficient expertise.  
2. **Geographical Restrictions:** Insurers may face restrictions on the countries in which they can write business, often to prevent exposure to volatile risks or unfamiliar legal and regulatory systems.  
3. **Initial Authorization and Staffing:** Initial authorization is required for new insurance companies, ensuring they have appropriate expertise and sufficient capital. Furthermore, restrictions may be placed on individuals holding key roles within the company, ensuring management is "fit and proper".  
4. **Intermediary Licensing:** Regulators require the licensing of agents who sell insurance and often impose requirements regarding the methods of sale and the disclosure of commission or broking terms.

### **II. Prudential Requirements: Solvency and Capital**

These requirements are designed to ensure the financial strength and stability of insurers, providing a safety margin against the uncertainty of liabilities and asset values.

1. **Minimum Solvency Levels:** Insurers are required to maintain a **minimum level of solvency** (free assets), measured in a prescribed manner. This requirement might, for example, be calculated as a proportion of premiums written.  
2. **Risk-Based Capital (e.g., Solvency II):** Increasingly, requirements follow a risk-based approach. Solvency II (SII), applicable in the EEA, mandates that firms meet capital requirements (SCR/MCR) with assets and liabilities valued on a **market-consistent basis**. The Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) must fall within a range, typically between 25% and 45% of the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). Risk-based models ensure that a riskier portfolio requires higher capital, even if the written premium volume is lower.  
3. **Prescribed Valuation Bases:** Regulators may require insurers to use **prescribed bases** for valuing assets and/or liabilities when demonstrating solvency. This ensures consistent and often Underwriting Limits

These regulations directly affect the pricing actuary's role, constraining the freedom to set rates based solely on technical indication, prioritizing consumer protection and fairness.

1. **Controls on Premium Rates:** Regulators can impose **limits or controls on premium rates** that can be charged. This may involve:  
   * Setting maximum or minimum premiums.  
   * Restricting how premiums are calculated, such as setting a maximum allowance for expenses defined as a percentage of the gross premium.  
   * Requiring rates to be **filed** (submitted for approval) before use (common in some US states).  
   * Requiring publication of premium rates to prevent anti-competitive practices.  
2. **Restrictions on Rating Factors:** Rules are set to restrict the information used in underwriting and premium rating to avoid unfair discrimination.  
   * **EU Gender Directive:** European insurers have been prohibited from using gender as a rating factor.  
   * **Credit Score:** Some jurisdictions limit or ban the use of insurance credit score for rating due to its perceived correlation with certain socio-demographic variables.  
3. **Prescribed Use of Techniques:** Regulations can prescribe the use of certain ratemaking techniques. For instance, the state of Washington requires multivariate classification analysis if insurance credit score is used in personal automobile insurance.  
4. **Mandatory Cover:** Legislation may require the provision of certain coverages, such as motor third-party liability.  
5. **Fairness Requirements:** Insurers are required to ensure fairness in the treatment of customers.

### **IV. Transparency and Oversight: Reporting Requirements**

Reporting requirements enable regulators to monitor characteristics, risks, and solvency of an insurer.

1. **Financial and Audit Disclosure:** A requirement exists for an external audit of the general insurer’s accounts and the public release of certain information pertaining to the insurer.  
2. **Regular Reporting:** Insurers are typically required to provide detailed reports and accounts at prescribed intervals. These reports cover both qualitative and quantitative information, including premiums, exposures, claim amounts, counterparty exposures, assets, solvency values, and complaints.  
3. **Statutory Actuarial Reports:** A requirement for a **Statement of Actuarial Opinion (SAO)** to be produced by an approved actuary promotes confidence in the level of reserves and helps to prevent company failure.  
4. **Risk Management Reporting (SII Pillar 3):** Under Solvency II, insurers must produce reports and disclosures. Key documents include the public Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) and the private Regular Supervisory Report (RSR), which contain quantitative templates (QRTs) and detailed narrative information on business, performance, governance, risk profile, and capital.  
5. **Data Filing:** Regulators often require companies to file statistical data in a consistent format through "Statistical Plans" or "Data Calls".
