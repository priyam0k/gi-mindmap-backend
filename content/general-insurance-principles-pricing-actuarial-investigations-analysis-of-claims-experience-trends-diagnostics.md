As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on the Analysis of Claims Experience, focusing on trends and diagnostics within the broader topic of Actuarial Investigations. This is a crucial area for both pricing (SP8) and reserving (SP7), forming a core part of the actuarial control cycle.

### **Actuarial Investigations: Analysis of Claims Experience**

Actuarial investigations are fundamental to the financial management of a general insurer, informing key decisions in pricing, reserving, and capital modelling. A major component of these investigations is the analysis of claims experience, which involves using historical data to understand past performance and project future costs. The primary tools for this analysis are diagnostics and the measurement of trends.

#### **1\. The Purpose and Context of Claims Experience Analysis**

The analysis of claims experience is a core activity for actuaries, providing essential insights for various purposes. For pricing actuaries, the goal is to use past data to estimate future claim costs, which form the basis of the risk premium. For reserving actuaries, the analysis informs the setting of adequate technical provisions.

Key investigations that rely on claims experience analysis include:

* **Premium Rating:** Estimating the cost of claims for recent periods as an intermediate step in the rating process.  
* **Profitability Assessment:** Evaluating the profitability of existing premium rates by comparing actual experience against expected outcomes.  
* **Capital Modelling:** Providing inputs for assessing capital requirements for various risks, particularly insurance risk.  
* **Validating Assumptions:** Forming a critical part of the actuarial control cycle by monitoring emerging experience against expectations, allowing assumptions to be refined.

#### **2\. Diagnostics: Tools for Understanding Claims Experience**

Diagnostics are measures used to interpret claims data, test underlying assumptions, and check the reasonableness of results. They provide a high-level check and can indicate which areas of a portfolio require closer investigation. When reviewing diagnostics, it's vital to understand the reasons for any changes over time or unusual features identified.

Several key diagnostic ratios are used:

* **Frequency:** Measures the rate of claim incidence, typically calculated as the number of claims divided by the number of exposures. Analysing frequency helps identify trends in claim occurrence and measure the effectiveness of underwriting actions.  
* **Severity:** Measures the average cost per claim, calculated as total losses divided by the number of claims. It provides insights into loss trends and the impact of changes in claims handling procedures.  
* **Pure Premium (or Loss Cost):** Measures the average loss per exposure and is the product of frequency and severity. It is a key statistic in the Pure Premium method of ratemaking and highlights overall trends in loss costs.  
* **Loss Ratio:** Measures the proportion of each premium dollar used to pay for losses, calculated as losses divided by premium. It is a primary measure of rate adequacy and profitability.

Other important diagnostics include:

* **Paid-to-Incurred Ratios:** Can indicate the strength of case reserving. For instance, an increasing trend may suggest that case reserve strength has been reduced or that the claim settlement pattern has accelerated.  
* **Average Outstanding Case Estimate:** Reviewing this can highlight changes in case reserving strength over time.  
* **Ratio of IBNR to Case Estimates:** Particularly helpful for mature cohorts in long-tailed classes where IBNR is primarily composed of IBNER (incurred but not enough reported).

When using diagnostics, actuaries must consider the granularity of the data. While it's beneficial to analyze data in homogeneous groups, this must be balanced against the need for statistical credibility.

#### **3\. Trend Analysis: Projecting Historical Experience into the Future**

Historical loss data must be adjusted for underlying trends to accurately project costs for the future period when rates will be effective. This process, often called "trending," accounts for factors that change expected frequency and severity levels over time.

**3.1. Drivers of Loss Trends**

Loss trends are driven by a variety of factors, including:

* **Economic Factors:** Monetary inflation, rising medical costs, and changes in wage levels directly impact claim severity.  
* **Social Influences:** Changes in societal attitudes, such as increased claim consciousness or changes in court practices and legal precedents, can affect both frequency and severity.  
* **Technological Factors:** Advancements in safety technology can reduce claim frequency, while more complex technology (eg, in vehicles) can increase repair costs and thus severity.  
* **Distributional Changes:** Shifts in the mix of business written by an insurer can alter the overall frequency and severity of the portfolio.

**3.2. Measuring and Applying Loss Trends**

Actuaries typically measure trends by fitting curves (often linear or exponential) to historical data points of frequency, severity, and pure premium. It is best practice to analyze frequency and severity trends separately to better understand the underlying drivers of change.

The trend analysis should be performed on a homogeneous body of claims, adjusted for quantifiable effects like seasonality and legislative benefit changes to avoid distortion. The choice of data (eg, paid losses vs. ultimate losses) depends on the line of business; paid data is often used for short-tailed lines to avoid distortions from reserving changes, while developed ultimate losses are preferred for long-tailed lines.

Once an annual trend rate is selected, it must be applied over a calculated **trend period**. This period measures the time from the average occurrence date of the historical experience period to the average occurrence date of the future forecast period.

* **Example Calculation for a 12-month policy:** For an analysis using Accident Year 2011 data to set rates for Policy Year 2015, the "trend from" date is the midpoint of AY2011 (July 1, 2011). The "trend to" date is the midpoint of the exposure period for PY2015 policies (which run from Jan 1, 2015 to Dec 31, 2016), which is December 31, 2015\. The resulting trend period is 4.5 years.

**3.3. One-Step vs. Two-Step Trending**

* **One-Step Trending:** A single selected trend factor is applied to adjust historical data directly to the future policy period level. This is appropriate when trends are relatively consistent.  
* **Two-Step Trending:** This method is used when the historical trend differs from what is expected in the future.  
  1. **Current Trend Step:** Adjusts each historical year to the cost level of the most recent available data point.  
  2. **Projected Trend Step:** Applies a different, forward-looking trend to project the "current level" data into the future policy period.

**3.4. Coordinating with Premium and Exposure Trends**

When performing a loss ratio analysis, it is crucial that premium, loss, and (if applicable) exposure trends are treated consistently. An actuary might analyze trends in the adjusted loss ratio itself (a "net" trend) or, preferably, analyze the components—frequency, severity, and average premium—separately for a better understanding of the drivers.

#### **4\. Professional and Practical Considerations**

The analysis of claims experience requires significant actuarial judgment. Actuaries must be aware of data limitations, understand the nuances of the business, and communicate uncertainties effectively. When results from different methods diverge, the actuary must investigate the reasons and select the most appropriate basis for the specific purpose of the investigation. The ultimate goal is to apply knowledge to solve problems, often in novel circumstances, by drawing upon actuarial techniques and the information available.
