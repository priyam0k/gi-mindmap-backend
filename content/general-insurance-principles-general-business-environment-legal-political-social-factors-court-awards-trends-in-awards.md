As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, understanding the **Trends in Awards** set by courts is critical, as these judicial decisions are primary drivers of claims severity and instability within the Legal, Political, and Social risk environment. These factors necessitate continuous monitoring and careful incorporation into pricing and reserving assumptions.

The sources identify a distinct trend toward increased cost and complexity in compensation for liability claims, often manifesting as sudden, difficult-to-predict increases.

---

## **I. The Trend of Increasing Generosity**

Court awards set the **benchmarks** for liability claims, even though most cases are ultimately settled out of court through negotiation. In many markets, compensation for negligence has generally become **more generous**.

This trend of increasing cost is observed in two main ways, leading to an increase in both frequency and severity from the insurer’s perspective:

1. **Increased Frequency:** Courts may be **more willing to accept that liability exists** for a victim's suffering (and even that suffering exists).  
2. **Increased Severity:** Given that liability is decided, courts may award **larger amounts for similar losses**.

### **II. Judicial and Social Inflation**

The upward trend in awards is fueled by distinct inflationary mechanisms that often exceed general economic inflation.

1. **Court Inflation:** This refers specifically to the escalation of compensation amounts set by judicial decisions.

   * **Volatility:** Court inflation historically tends to be **higher and less predictable** than price inflation.  
   * **Step Changes:** Unlike gradual price inflation, court inflation tends to remain level for periods but then increase in **sharp jumps** when new precedents are created or legislation comes into effect.  
2. **Social/Superimposed Inflation:** This refers to the phenomenon where awards for pain and suffering and other non-wage-related costs grow at a faster rate than general price or wage inflation.

   * **Judgmental Setting:** Awards for pain and suffering tend to be set **judgementally** (subjectively) rather than according to fixed criteria.  
   * **New Heads of Damage:** This social trend contributes to increasing costs through the emergence of new **heads of damage**, such as awards for 'bullying' or 'post traumatic stress disorder'.

### **III. Systemic Changes Affecting Quantification**

Trends in awards are also fundamentally affected by legal changes regarding how compensation is calculated, particularly for long-term personal injury claims.

1. **Discount Rate Changes (Ogden Tables):** Courts may change the rate of interest used to discount future earnings, which can have a dramatic effect upon overall claim payments and reserves.

   * **Impact:** A low discount rate results in a proportionally **high lump sum award**. The sharp reduction in the UK Ogden rate in March 2017 caused a **significant one-off increase in reserves** for bodily injury claims with a future loss of earnings component.  
2. **Periodic Payment Orders (PPOs):** Legislation (such as the Courts Act in the UK) empowered courts to impose structured settlements or PPOs (regular payments) as compensation for future earnings, even when both parties preferred lump sums. Paying claims via PPOs is expected to **increase the cost of claims to insurers** because annuities can be expensive to purchase and administration is more complex.

3. **Jury/Judge Influence:** In the US, tort trials are decided by juries who are also responsible for setting awards, providing another source of upward trend. Some US states have enacted **tort reform** laws to constrain the freedom of juries, often by placing monetary limits on compensation.

### **IV. Actuarial and Financial Implications of Trends**

The unpredictability of these trends creates a significant risk for insurers.

1. **Retrospective Losses:** An unexpected increase in compensation awards affects policies whose risk period has already expired. Since premiums cannot be changed retrospectively, such changes will adversely affect profits and can lead to **inadequate claims reserves**.

2. **Increased Uncertainty:** The rate of change in compensation trends is hard to predict. Actuaries must therefore incorporate **additional contingency loadings** or higher risk margins in premiums to cover the uncertainty associated with these future trends. The unexpected increase in trend was cited as a major reason why professional liability insurers had poor results in the 1960s and 1970s.

3. **Latent Claims Exacerbation:** Judicial decisions can apply **retrospectively over many policies** and can significantly affect the extent of an insurer’s liability for **latent claims**, resulting in large losses for the insurer.
