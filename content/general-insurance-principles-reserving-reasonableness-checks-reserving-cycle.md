Alright my diligent SP7 candidates, let's delve into a truly fascinating and often challenging aspect of General Insurance Reserving: the **Reserving Cycle** and its critical interaction with **Reasonableness Checks**. As Specialist Actuarial Note Builders and Exam Coaches, it's our duty to ensure you not only understand the *what* but also the *why* and *how* this impacts your practical work and, naturally, your exam performance.

### **1\. The Reserving Cycle: Unpacking the Phenomenon**

My dear students, the concept of a 'reserving cycle' is a nuanced one that has gained increasing recognition in recent years. It refers to a cyclical pattern observed in the setting of general insurance reserves, often showing a strong correlation with the **underwriting cycle**. You'll recall from your studies on the external environment that the underwriting cycle describes the periodic fluctuations in premium rates and profitability within the insurance market. In a "soft market," premiums are low, terms and conditions are loosened, and competition is fierce; conversely, a "hard market" sees higher premiums and stricter terms.

So, why does a reserving cycle exist? The sources highlight several potential reasons for this phenomenon:

* **Weakened Terms and Conditions:** In soft markets, as underwriters chase volume, policy terms and conditions may become less stringent. This can lead to claims arising that are more complex or protracted, impacting reserve adequacy.  
* **Increasing Tendency to Dispute Claims:** A shift in market dynamics or economic conditions might lead to an increase in policyholders disputing claims, which can lengthen settlement patterns and increase claims costs, subsequently affecting reserve estimations.  
* **Less Conservative Reserving:** When market results are poorer, there might be pressure, or a tendency, for reserving teams to adopt a less conservative approach to case reserving in an attempt to improve reported profitability.

This cyclical over-estimation or under-estimation of *booked reserves* (what the company actually holds in its accounts) is ultimately a decision for the Board. However, it's crucial to remember that this *should not impact the actuaryâ€™s best estimate*. As actuaries, your role is to provide a realistic "best estimate," though you may also indicate a *range* of best estimates within which the Board's decision should ideally lie.

Insurers generally desire to "flatten" this reserving cycle. Why?

* **Improved Reserve Accuracy:** A flatter cycle implies more consistent and accurate reserves, reducing the likelihood of setting insufficient reserves in past years, which can negatively impact ongoing business performance.  
* **Clearer Profitability Understanding:** By smoothing out the reserve fluctuations, the true profitability of different lines of business becomes more readily discernible. This clarity enables management to make informed decisions about whether to continue, contract, or expand specific classes.

It's particularly important to note that the evidence of a reserving cycle is more pronounced for **long-tailed business**. This makes perfect sense, as these classes (e.g., liability, professional indemnity) have a prolonged claims development period, allowing for longer-term trends and influences to become apparent in the reserving process.

### **2\. Reasonableness Checks: The Actuarial Sentinel**

Now, let's connect this with the broader and immensely important domain of **Reasonableness Checks** in reserving. As your exam coach, I cannot stress enough the criticality of Chapter 17, which focuses precisely on the assessment of reserving results. The core focus of a reserving exercise is to determine a *point estimate of the best estimate reserves*. However, this is merely the starting point.

It is **imperative** that actuaries check that their reserving figures are justifiable and that the chosen methodology and underlying assumptions are appropriate. This is where a robust framework of diagnostic tools and a meticulous analysis of emerging experience come into play. The process revolves around two fundamental questions you must always ask yourself:

1. **Are the results selected reasonable?**  
2. **Are the new results supported by an analysis of emerging experience?**

A common approach to address the second question is the "Actual versus Expected" (A v E) exercise. This involves comparing the actual experience observed since the last review against what was *expected* to emerge during that period based on your previous assumptions. Any significant deviation necessitates an update to your selected assumptions to reflect the most recent trends.

A crucial pitfall to avoid in this process is **anchoring**. Anchoring is the cognitive bias where one relies too heavily on an initial piece of information (e.g., prior year's reserves) when making subsequent decisions. In reserving, anchoring can lead to a dangerous scenario where assumptions are not adjusted quickly enough in response to emerging trends, causing results to gradually cease being reasonable over time. You must find a balance between stability and responsiveness, periodically reviewing the accuracy of previous estimates and methods to learn what works well in different situations.

Ultimately, a balance must be struck between the deeper understanding gained from these analyses and the associated costs and time involved. The final selection of results requires the application of sound **actuarial judgement** and experience. This systematic review is analogous to the **feedback stage of the actuarial control cycle**, where deviations are noted, their reasons understood, and appropriate adjustments are fed back into the process.

### **3\. Integrating the Reserving Cycle into Reasonableness Checks**

Now, let's tie these two critical concepts together. How does awareness of the reserving cycle specifically inform your reasonableness checks?

The reserving actuary must be acutely aware of the market's position in the underwriting cycle when setting reserves.

* **Initial Expected Loss Ratios:** For methods that rely on an initial expected loss ratio (e.g., Bornhuetter-Ferguson), this assumption should be chosen to account for the current stage of both the reserving and underwriting cycles. If you're in a soft market, for instance, you might expect loss ratios to deteriorate, and your initial expected loss ratio should reflect this.  
* **Rate Indices:** One practical way to allow for the underwriting cycle in reserving exercises is to use a **rate index** when deriving these initial expected loss ratios. This index aims to adjust premiums for historical rate movements, providing a more consistent "true" premium base. However, be cautious:  
  * Rate indices are often available primarily for *renewal business* and may not adequately capture differences between new and renewed business.  
  * They can sometimes be constructed based on subjective information, such as underwriters' views, rather than robust data, introducing potential bias. This is a critical area for actuarial scrutiny\!  
* **Development Patterns:** The underwriting cycle can also influence claims development patterns. For example, development patterns tend to be *longer in a soft market* due to factors like increased litigation or less aggressive claims management. Your reasonableness checks should assess whether the selected development patterns adequately reflect these cycle-driven changes.

When performing your diagnostics, you should specifically look for indicators that might be influenced by the reserving cycle:

* **Changes in Loss Ratios:** Reviewing trends in paid, outstanding, IBNR, incurred, and ultimate loss ratios can highlight shifts in premium rating strength or reserving philosophy, which are hallmarks of the underwriting and reserving cycles.  
* **Unusual Features:** Diagnostics that highlight unexpected or unusual features should prompt a deep dive. For instance, if the ratio of IBNR to case estimates behaves unusually, it might signal a change in case reserving practices influenced by the cycle.  
* **Consistency over Time:** Scrutinise whether the underlying assumptions and methodologies remain appropriate given the evolving market environment influenced by the cycle.

### **4\. The Indispensable Role of Judgement and Communication**

At the heart of both estimating reserves and conducting reasonableness checks lies **actuarial judgement**. Reserving is, fundamentally, not an exact science. Two actuaries, even with the same data and purpose, might arrive at different best estimates due to differing judgements. This underscores why the process is as much an art as a science, requiring you to marry quantitative techniques with qualitative insights.

Therefore, **effective communication** of your reserving basis, including ranges and uncertainties, is paramount. When presenting your findings, especially concerning the impact of cycles, you must:

* **Clearly Define Terms:** Ensure your audience understands what a "best estimate" means in context, and how it relates to concepts like the reserving cycle.  
* **Explain Assumptions and Limitations:** Articulate the assumptions made (e.g., regarding future inflation, interest rates, or the impact of cycle changes), their rationale, and any limitations of your models.  
* **Highlight Key Judgements:** Explicitly state the material judgements that had a significant impact on your estimates.  
* **Discuss Uncertainties:** Explain the various sources of uncertainty (model, parameter, process error) and how your estimates account for them. For cycle-related impacts, discussing the potential for unforeseen shifts in market behavior or claims trends is vital.  
* **Contextualise:** Comment on the uncertainty within the specific scope and purpose of the reserving exercise.

In essence, understanding the reserving cycle is not just academic; it's a vital component of your professional toolkit for producing reliable reserve estimates and demonstrating their reasonableness. By proactively incorporating its dynamics into your analysis and communicating your judgements transparently, you elevate the quality and trustworthiness of your actuarial work. This comprehensive understanding will serve you well, both in your professional career and, of course, in conquering that SP7 exam\!
