*Exam Coach Tip: Legal Expenses Cover is a good example of an ancillary product often bundled with larger policies. If a question mentions a household or small commercial package policy, including Legal Expenses as a potential add-on demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of product composition. Note its short-tail nature and the unusual hybrid basis of cover (losses-occurring and claims-made), as this is a distinguishing feature. The use of **policyholder-years** as an exposure measure is also a key detail to remember.*
