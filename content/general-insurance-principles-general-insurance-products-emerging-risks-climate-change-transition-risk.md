As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a focused and detailed note on **Climate Change Transition Risk**. This is a crucial component of the broader topic of **Emerging Risks**, a key area of the syllabus that tests your understanding of risks that are not well-represented in historical data and may threaten an insurer's profitability or solvency.

### **The General Business Environment: Emerging Risks**

First, let's place this topic in its correct syllabus context. An emerging risk is a risk that is not yet well understood or prominent, and for which current risk management techniques may be less appropriate over time. These risks are a major source of uncertainty for insurers because traditional actuarial techniques, which rely on historical data, are difficult to apply.

Climate change is a prime example of such a risk. It is a common driver that can affect multiple lines of business simultaneously, potentially increasing correlations between previously independent risks. The sources categorise climate-related risks to the insurance industry into three distinct types:

1. **Physical Risks**: Due to extreme weather events caused by climate change (e.g., increased frequency of hurricanes).  
2. **Liability Risks**: Associated with compensation claims for losses due to physical or transition risks (e.g., D\&O claims against companies for failing to consider climate change).  
3. **Transition Risks**: Associated with societyâ€™s move towards a low-carbon economy.

We will now focus specifically on **Transition Risk**.

#### **ðŸ”¸ Climate Change: Transition Risk**

**Definition**: Transition risk is the risk associated with societyâ€™s transition towards a low-carbon economy, aimed at minimising greenhouse gas emissions. These risks can become more pronounced as the world moves in this direction, leading to changes in risk profiles for insurers and the emergence of new risk types.

##### **1\. Drivers and Manifestations of Transition Risk**

Transition risks arise from the societal and economic shifts required to mitigate and adapt to climate change. These can manifest in several ways that directly impact an insurer's operations, particularly its assets and the commercial risks it underwrites.

* **Government Policy and Regulation**: Governments implementing policies to reduce global warming could directly reduce the value of assets held by an insurer. A key example cited is the risk that an insurer's holdings in fossil fuel companies could be devalued as these sectors face stricter regulations or carbon taxes. This directly impacts an insurer's market risk profile.

* **Technological and Market Shifts**: The move to a low-carbon economy creates winners and losers. Insurers face risks and opportunities related to these shifts:

  * **Changes in Commercial Risks**: Insurers may see altered risk profiles from their commercial policyholders due to the adoption of more sustainable manufacturing processes.  
  * **Changes in Motor Liability**: The replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources for vehicles will change motor liability risks.  
  * **Increased Product Liability**: The adoption of new technologies, such as high-energy storage batteries, introduces new product liability risks due to a high risk of overheating and explosion.  
* **Market and Stakeholder Pressure**: There is increasing pressure on insurers to withdraw insurance support from companies in the fossil fuel sector, such as coal producers and oil companies. This is a strategic and reputational risk that insurers must manage.

##### **2\. Impact on Insurers' Operations**

* **Investment and Asset Management**: Transition risk is a significant consideration for an insurer's investment strategy and asset-liability management (ALM). The potential for "stranded assets" (assets that suffer from unanticipated or premature write-downs) in carbon-intensive sectors is a major market risk for an insurer's balance sheet.

* **Underwriting and Pricing**: Insurers must adapt their underwriting and pricing to account for the changing risk profiles of their policyholders. For example, insuring a company involved in renewable energy technology presents different risks compared to a traditional energy company. The lack of historical data for these new technologies makes pricing more uncertain.

* **Capital Modelling**: Transition risks represent "Events Not In Data" (ENIDs) that must be considered in capital modelling to avoid underestimating capital requirements. Standard formula approaches may not adequately capture these risks, highlighting the importance of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) for insurers to assess their specific exposures.

* **Governance and Regulation**: There is a regulatory requirement for insurers to embed the consideration of financial risks from climate change, including transition risks, into their governance arrangements. This ensures that senior management adequately takes account of the potential impact on the business.

*Exam Coach Tip: Questions on emerging risks like climate change test your ability to think beyond historical data and apply principles to novel, uncertain situations. When discussing transition risk, a strong answer will clearly define it and differentiate it from physical and liability risks. Use concrete examples provided in the sources, such as the devaluation of fossil fuel assets (market risk) and new product liability claims from green technologies (underwriting risk). Highlighting the impact across different actuarial functionsâ€”pricing, reserving, capital (especially ENIDs and the ORSA), and investment strategyâ€”will demonstrate the holistic, higher-order thinking required for SP8 and SA3.*
