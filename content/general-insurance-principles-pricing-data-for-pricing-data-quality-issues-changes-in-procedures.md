Of course. As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed, structured note focusing on **Changes in Procedures** as a critical Data Quality Issue. This is a highly practical and examinable topic for SP8, as procedural changes are a common source of distortions in the historical data used for pricing. Failure to recognise and adjust for these changes violates the "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (GIGO) principle, leading to flawed analysis and potentially inadequate or uncompetitive rates.

### **ðŸ“— Data Quality Issues: Changes in Procedures**

The ratemaking process is fundamentally **prospective**, using historical data to estimate future costs. The entire process relies on the assumption that this historical data is a reliable and relevant predictor of the future. A significant data quality issue arises when internal company procedures change over time, as this can introduce distortions that make the historical data less comparable and therefore less reliable for trend and development analysis.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 1\. The Consequence of Procedural Changes**

Procedural changes can severely distort historical data, undermining the stability of claim development patterns and making it difficult to perform reliable analysis. If these distortions are not identified and adjusted for, any actuarial investigationâ€”from pricing to reservingâ€”will be flawed. This leads to:

* **Incorrect premium rates**, exposing the insurer to underwriting losses or loss of market share.  
* **Adverse selection**, as a flawed premium structure will fail to charge equitable rates for different risk segments.  
* **Inaccurate reserving**, as development patterns will be distorted, leading to flawed ultimate loss projections. This directly impacts the loss inputs into the pricing models.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 2\. Types of Procedural Changes and Their Impact**

The sources highlight several types of procedural changes that can distort the data used for pricing.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.1 Changes in Claim Handling Procedures**

Alterations in how claims are processed and recorded are a major source of data distortion.

* **Definition of a Claim:** Changes in the rules governing when a notified loss is formally accepted and recorded as a claim can affect the recorded number of claims, the count of nil claims, and the apparent speed of claim notification. This directly impacts claim frequency statistics.  
* **Claim Closure Rules:** Inconsistent practices regarding when a claim file is formally closed can affect the apparent development of claims cohorts, distorting run-off triangles.  
* **Treatment of Reopened Claims:** A change in procedure where reopened claims are incorrectly treated as new claims would distort claim frequency and misallocate the loss amount to the wrong origin year, corrupting the historical experience.  
* **Processing Delays or Speed-ups:** If the rate at which claims are processed alters due to backlogs, clear-outs, or new systems, it will distort claim development patterns. For example, a new claims process that speeds up settlement will make historical development patterns (when settlement was slower) an unreliable predictor for recent accident years.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.2 Changes in Case Reserving Philosophy**

The approach claims handlers take to setting case reserves can have a profound impact on incurred loss data.

* A shift from a **prudent to a realistic** reserving basis (or vice versa) can significantly distort incurred loss development patterns. This makes historical link ratios less comparable over time and undermines the reliability of incurred loss development analysis.  
* Changes in how case estimates are first set up, how often they are revised, or the underlying method (eg, formulaic vs. adjuster judgement) will impact the consistency of incurred data over time.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.3 Changes in Systems and Data Recording**

The introduction of new systems or changes in how data is recorded can create inconsistencies.

* **Legacy Systems:** An insurer formed from a merger may have multiple legacy systems with inconsistent data definitions and coding, creating significant distortions when data is combined for analysis.  
* **Data Capture:** Changes to data capture forms (proposal and claim forms) or staff training can alter the quality and consistency of data entered into the system over time.  
* **Coding:** Inconsistent coding of risk factors or claim types makes historical data less comparable and undermines classification ratemaking.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 3\. Mitigation and Management Strategies**

The actuary must be diligent in identifying and adjusting for the impact of procedural changes.

* **Communication:** Regular discussions with other departments, particularly the claims department, are crucial for staying informed about any operational changes. Actuaries should understand the history of claims handling procedures and any known events that could create an anomaly in development patterns.  
* **Analysis and Adjustments:**  
  * If a change in claim settlement patterns is identified, methods like the **Berquist-Sherman method** can be used to restate historical development data to be consistent with the most recent settlement rates.  
  * If case reserving adequacy has changed, again the Berquist-Sherman method may be appropriate.  
  * When selecting link ratios in a chain ladder analysis, any distortions caused by procedural changes should be considered, and the actuary may need to exclude certain link ratios from the average or use professional judgement to adjust them.  
* **Data Segmentation:** Where possible, it is beneficial to split data into homogeneous groups that have not been affected by the procedural change. For example, if a change only affects a certain type of claim, that type should be analysed separately.  
* **Model Selection:** The actuary should choose a reserving method that is robust to the specific procedural change. For example, if incurred data is distorted by changes in case reserving philosophy, it may be more appropriate to rely on paid data for development and trend analysis.

In conclusion, changes in internal procedures are a significant data quality issue that can make historical information an unreliable guide to the future. It is a key responsibility of the pricing actuary to investigate, understand, and make appropriate adjustments for these changes to ensure that the data used as the foundation for pricing is as reliable and relevant as possible.
