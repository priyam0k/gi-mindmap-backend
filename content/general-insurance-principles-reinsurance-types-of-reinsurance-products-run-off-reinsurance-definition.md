As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on the **Definition of Run-off Reinsurance**, placing it within the broader syllabus topic of alternative reinsurance solutions. This concept is particularly relevant for the SP7, SP8, and SA3 exams as it represents a key strategic tool for insurers managing discontinued lines of business.

##### **ðŸ”¸ Run-off Reinsurance: Definition**

**Definition**: Run-off reinsurance is a term used to describe reinsurance arrangements specifically designed to handle a **closed book of business**. The primary objective of these solutions is the **transfer of reserve development risks** from the ceding insurer to a reinsurer. In essence, it provides cover against the earnings volatility that arises from an insurer's past underwriting activities, allowing the insurer to achieve a degree of finality for a discontinued portfolio.

In practice, the term "run-off reinsurance" is often used to cover two distinct types of arrangements that serve this strategic purpose: Adverse Development Cover (ADC) and Loss Portfolio Transfers (LPTs).

###### **1\. Adverse Development Cover (ADC)**

* **Core Definition**: An Adverse Development Cover is a specific type of reinsurance contract where a reinsurer, in return for a premium, agrees to cover the ultimate settled amount of a specified block of business **above a certain pre-agreed amount**.  
* **Mechanism**: It functions like a non-proportional stop loss or excess of loss contract applied to a closed, run-off book of business. The reinsurer's liability attaches at a pre-agreed level which can be set relative to the cedant's current reserves:  
  * **Out of the money**: Attachment point is above current reserves.  
  * **At the money**: Attachment point is equal to current reserves.  
  * **In the money**: Attachment point is below current reserves.  
* **Key Feature**: Crucially, under an ADC, the **reserves are maintained by the original insurer**, which also continues to handle the claims and receive the investment income from the assets backing those reserves. The original insurer remains legally liable to the policyholders; the ADC only provides protection against the reinsurer's credit risk.

###### **2\. Loss Portfolio Transfers (LPTs)**

* **Core Definition**: A Loss Portfolio Transfer is an arrangement where the liability for a specified book of business is **passed in its entirety** from one insurer to another. While often discussed as a run-off solution, it is technically not a form of reinsurance but a complete transfer of business.  
* **Mechanism**: An LPT is a more final exit solution that often requires a legal **novation**, which substitutes the new insurer for the original one with the agreement of all parties or with court approval (such as a Part VII transfer in the UK).  
* **Key Feature**: Unlike an ADC, the **reserves are transferred** from the original insurer to the new insurer, along with all remaining exposure. The new insurer takes on all adverse claims risk and receives all future investment income on the transferred assets. This achieves a greater degree of finality, as liabilities do not fall back on the original insurer if the new insurer defaults.

*Exam Coach Tip: For your SP8 and SA3 exams, it is crucial to distinguish between the two main types of run-off solutions. A question asking you to define or discuss run-off reinsurance requires you to explain both Adverse Development Cover and Loss Portfolio Transfers. For higher-order marks, you must highlight the key difference: an **ADC** is a true reinsurance product that transfers the **risk of reserve deterioration** above a certain point, but the cedant retains the reserves and ultimate liability to the policyholder. In contrast, an **LPT** is a more final business transfer that passes the **entirety of the liability** and the associated reserves to a new entity, typically via novation.*
