As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note sequence on **Fixed Benefit** insurance, positioning it as a distinct category within the broader context of the **Types of Cover** offered by general insurance products, as outlined in the provided sources.

### **The Larger Context: The Four Principal Types of Cover**

The sources classify all general insurance products under four main types of cover. Understanding where Fixed Benefit insurance fits is crucial to distinguishing it from the other product types that primarily operate on the principle of indemnity. The four categories are:

1. **Liability to Third Parties:** Covers the insured's legal liability to pay compensation to others.  
2. **Property Damage:** Covers loss of or damage to the policyholder's own material property.  
3. **Financial Loss:** Covers financial losses that are distinct from direct property damage or liability claims.  
4. **Fixed Benefits:** Pays a pre-agreed, fixed amount on the occurrence of a specified event, regardless of the actual financial loss incurred.

Fixed Benefit insurance is unique because it explicitly moves away from the **Principle of Indemnity**, which seeks to restore the insured to their financial position immediately before the loss. Instead, it provides a pre-agreed sum for a specified event.

### **1\. The Core Principle and Purpose of Fixed Benefit Insurance**

* **Core Principle:** This type of cover pays specified, pre-agreed fixed amounts upon the occurrence of a defined event, rather than indemnifying for the actual financial loss incurred.  
* **Customer Need:** This meets the need for financial compensation for events, such as accidental injury, where quantifying the true financial loss can be difficult or impossible. For example, it is very hard to place a precise monetary value on the loss of a limb. The insurance contract specifies the amount to be paid in such an event.  
* **Product Example:** The primary example provided in the sources is **Personal Accident Insurance**. This cover can be offered on a group basis by an employer or combined with other policies like motor insurance.

### **2\. Benefits Provided**

* **Fixed Payments:** The benefits are specified, fixed amounts for defined events.  
* **Continental Scale:** Policies often use a reducing scale of benefits, known as a **continental scale**, for lesser injuries. Under this scale, each specified injury is worth a set proportion of the full sum insured.  
  * **Example:** A policyholder might select a level of cover (e.g., £50,000) which would be paid in full for permanent total disablement, with a pre-defined lesser amount paid for the loss of a single limb.  
* **Units of Cover:** Policies are often sold in units of sum insured (e.g., units of £25,000), allowing the policyholder to select the number of units they require, up to a maximum.  
* **Other Benefits:** Fixed benefits can also be granted for periods of disability or hospitalisation, typically as a fixed amount per day, week, or month, possibly after a waiting period.

### **3\. Risks and Characteristics for the Insurer**

From an insurer's perspective, Fixed Benefit products have a distinct and generally lower-risk profile compared to liability or property insurance.

* **Low Inflation Risk:** As the benefit amount is fixed in the policy, it is not subject to claims inflation. This is a significant advantage for the insurer compared to indemnity-based products, where inflation can dramatically increase the ultimate cost of claims.  
* **Claim Characteristics (Short-tail Nature):**  
  * Claims are typically reported quickly, as the occurrence of an event like an accident is usually very clear.  
  * Claims are usually settled quickly because the claim cost is known and defined in the policy.  
  * **Exception:** Delays can occur. For accidental death claims, dependants may not know the policy exists. More significantly, establishing whether a condition like 'permanent total disability' has been met can take several months or years, delaying settlement.  
* **Moral Hazard:** An insurer must be careful to avoid moral hazard by granting large sums insured for relatively minor injuries. While an individual is unlikely to risk their life for an insurance payout, the temptation might be greater for a minor injury if the compensation is disproportionately high.  
* **Claim Frequency and Severity:** Claim frequency tends to be reasonably stable, but claims can be large, with cover of several hundred thousand pounds per person not being uncommon.

### **4\. Pricing and Underwriting Considerations**

* **Measure of Exposure:** The true measure of exposure for Personal Accident insurance is the **person-year multiplied by the sum insured**. For group schemes where benefits are linked to salaries, the exposure measure is often the total sum insured or total salaries.  
* **Risk and Rating Factors:** The prime factor affecting the risk is usually **occupation**, distinguishing dangerous occupations from safer ones. Other measurable factors include:  
  * Age (cover is not normally sold to the elderly)  
  * Gender (though regulations like the EU Gender Directive may ban its use)  
  * Health condition  
  * Dangerous pastimes or hobbies

This classification provides a foundational framework. When pricing any product, it is crucial to first identify which type of cover it provides to understand its inherent risks, particularly whether it is indemnity-based or provides a fixed benefit, as this has significant implications for risk management, especially concerning inflation.
