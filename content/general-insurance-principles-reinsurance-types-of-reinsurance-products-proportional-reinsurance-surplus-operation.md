As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on the **Operation of Surplus Reinsurance**, placing it within the broader framework of proportional reinsurance. Understanding the mechanics of how this product works is fundamental for SP8 (Pricing), SP7 (Reserving and Capital), and its advanced application in SA3. The key operational difference from Quota Share is its flexibility, which makes it a more complex but also a more targeted risk management tool \[SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

##### **ðŸ”¸ Surplus Reinsurance: Operation**

Surplus reinsurance is a form of proportional reinsurance designed to give the ceding insurer (the cedant) more flexibility than a Quota Share treaty \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. Its operation is based on the insurer retaining a portion of each risk up to a pre-defined monetary limit, known as its "retention" or "line," and ceding the remainderâ€”the "surplus"â€”to the reinsurance treaty \[SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

###### **1\. Core Mechanism: Retention and Cession of Surplus**

The central principle of a surplus treaty is that the cedant establishes a retention for itself on each individual risk. Any part of the risk's size that exceeds this retention is ceded to the reinsurer(s) \[SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

* **Setting the Retention ("Line")**: The insurer decides the maximum amount of a risk it is willing to keep for its own account. This amount is called its retention or "line" \[SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. The treaty will specify a maximum retention level the insurer can choose (eg, Â£200,000) \[SP7.pdf\].  
* **Ceding the Surplus**: For any individual policy where the size of the risk exceeds the chosen retention, the excess amount is ceded to the surplus treaty \[SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. Risks with a size below the retention are retained 100% by the insurer and are not ceded to the treaty \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\].  
* **Measuring Risk Size**: To determine the amount to be ceded, the insurer needs a satisfactory measure of risk size. For property classes like commercial fire, the **Estimated Maximum Loss (EML)** or Sum Insured is typically used \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. The EML is the largest loss reasonably expected from a single event for that risk \[SP7.pdf\].

###### **2\. Sharing of Premiums and Losses**

A key operational feature is that the proportion of premium and losses shared between the cedant and reinsurer **varies for each individual risk**, depending on its size relative to the retention \[SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

**Example**: An insurer has a surplus treaty with a maximum retention of Â£200,000.

* **Risk A (EML \= Â£1,000,000)**: The insurer decides to retain its maximum line of Â£200,000.  
  * **Retention**: Â£200,000 (20% of the EML).  
  * **Cession**: The surplus of Â£800,000 (80% of the EML) is ceded to the reinsurer.  
  * **Sharing**: For this specific policy, the original premium and any subsequent losses are shared in a 20:80 ratio between the insurer and the reinsurer \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Risk B (EML \= Â£150,000)**: The EML is below the insurer's maximum retention.  
  * **Sharing**: The insurer retains 100% of this risk. Nothing is ceded to the surplus treaty \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\].

###### **3\. Treaty Capacity and the "Lines" System**

The capacity of a surplus treaty is defined as a multiple of the cedant's retention \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].

* **Number of Lines**: The reinsurer's maximum cover is expressed as a multiple of the cedant's line, known as the number of "lines" \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. For instance, a "10-line" treaty means the reinsurer can accept a surplus up to 10 times the cedant's retention on any single risk \[1423, 61, Reinsurance.pdf, 1424, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Total Treaty Capacity**: The maximum risk size that can be placed on a single treaty is the sum of the insurer's retention plus the reinsurer's capacity. For a 10-line treaty with a Â£250,000 retention, the total capacity is Â£2,750,000 (ie, (1+10) Ã— Â£250,000) \[1424, Reinsurance.pdf, 1435, 61, 1423, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Multiple Surplus Treaties**: For very large risks that exceed the capacity of the first treaty, a **second surplus treaty** (and sometimes a third or fourth) may be arranged to cover the remaining portion \[1435, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

###### **4\. Obligation Basis: Facultative/Obligatory (Fac/Oblig)**

Surplus treaties commonly operate on a **Facultative/Obligatory (Fac/Oblig)** basis \[Reinsurance.pdf, 4539\].

* This means the insurer has the **choice** (it is "facultative") of whether to cede a particular risk to the treaty.  
* However, the reinsurer is **obliged** to accept any risk offered, provided it meets the pre-agreed treaty criteria \[Reinsurance.pdf, 4539\].

This flexibility for the cedant creates a significant operational risk for the reinsurer: the risk of **adverse selection**. The cedant could potentially retain a higher proportion of its profitable risks and cede a larger share of its less profitable risks to the treaty \[Reinsurance.pdf, 4539\].

###### **5\. Administrative Operation and Unsuitability for Certain Lines**

* **Complexity**: The operation of a surplus treaty is administratively more complex than a Quota Share. It requires the insurer to assess, record, and track the specific retention and cession for **each individual risk** \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
* **Unsuitability for Liability**: Surplus reinsurance is unsuitable for liability classes of business. In these lines, there is often no effective Sum Insured or EML against which to calculate the surplus to be ceded \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

*Exam Coach Tip: When asked about the operation of a surplus treaty, your answer must be built around the concepts of **retention ("line")** and the **cession of the surplus**. Contrast its **flexibility** (variable cessions, Fac/Oblig basis) with the **simplicity but inflexibility** of Quota Share. A high-scoring answer will use a numerical example to demonstrate how proportions change with risk size. Crucially for SP8, you must highlight the operational risk of **adverse selection** that this structure creates for the reinsurer and explain why it is unsuitable for liability business.*
