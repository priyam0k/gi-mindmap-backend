As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note focusing specifically on the **Disadvantages of Surplus Reinsurance**. Understanding these drawbacks is crucial for providing a balanced comparison with other products like Quota Share, a common requirement in SP7, SP8, and SA3 exams \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, 11, 12, IAI\_SA3-Syllabus-2023\_Final.pdf\].

##### **ðŸ”¸ Surplus Reinsurance: Disadvantages**

While surplus reinsurance offers significant advantages in terms of flexibility and targeted risk management, it also has several notable disadvantages that can make it unsuitable for certain situations or challenging for the parties involved.

---

###### **1\. Administrative Complexity**

The primary disadvantage of surplus reinsurance is its administrative complexity, especially when compared to the simplicity of a quota share treaty \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].

* **Mechanism**: A quota share treaty requires a single, fixed percentage to be applied to the premium and claims totals for the entire portfolio covered \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. In contrast, a surplus treaty's operation is far more granular. It requires the ceding insurer to assess, record, and track the specific retention and cession for **each individual risk** that falls within the treaty's scope \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
* **Consequence**: This per-risk administration is significantly more work for the cedant, making it a more complex and administratively expensive form of reinsurance to manage \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].

###### **2\. Unsuitability for Liability Classes**

Surplus reinsurance is operationally unsuitable for liability classes of business, such as motor third party liability, employers' liability, or public liability \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Mechanism**: The operation of a surplus treaty depends on a clear monetary measure of the risk size, such as the Sum Insured or the Estimated Maximum Loss (EML) \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This measure is used to determine the cedant's retention (its "line") and calculate the "surplus" amount to be ceded to the reinsurer.  
* **Consequence**: Liability classes often have no effective Sum Insured or a meaningful way to estimate a maximum loss, as claims can be very large or even unlimited. Without a quantifiable risk size against which to calculate a surplus, the mechanism of a surplus treaty breaks down, making it an inappropriate product for these lines \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

---

###### **3\. Risk of Adverse Selection for the Reinsurer**

Surplus treaties are commonly written on a **Facultative/Obligatory (Fac/Oblig)** basis. This arrangement, while offering great flexibility to the cedant, creates a significant risk of adverse selection for the reinsurer \[Reinsurance.pdf, 4539\].

* **Mechanism**: On a Fac/Oblig basis, the ceding insurer has the choice ("facultative") of whether to cede a particular risk to the treaty. However, the reinsurer is **obliged** to accept any risk offered, provided it meets the treaty criteria \[Reinsurance.pdf, 4539\].  
* **Consequence**: This structure exposes the reinsurer to the risk that the cedant will only cede its less profitable business to the treaty. The cedant can analyze its risks and choose to retain a higher proportion of what it perceives to be "good" risks while passing on a larger share of the "bad" risks to the unsuspecting reinsurer. This potential for the reinsurer to be selected against is a key disadvantage from their perspective \[Reinsurance.pdf, 4539\].

*Exam Coach Tip: A strong SP8 exam answer requires you to not only list disadvantages but also explain their commercial and technical implications. When contrasting surplus with quota share, always highlight the trade-off: **Surplus offers flexibility at the cost of administrative complexity**. For higher-order marks, you must explain **why** it is unsuitable for liability business (linking it to the lack of an EML or Sum Insured) and clearly articulate the risk of **adverse selection** that the Fac/Oblig basis creates for the reinsurer. This demonstrates a deep understanding of the product's operational limitations and the differing perspectives of the cedant and reinsurer.*
