As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on **Credit Insurance**, placing it within the broader category of **Financial Loss Insurance**. This product line is important as its performance is highly sensitive to the economic environment, a key theme in both SP7 and SP8.

### **Specific Product Lines: Financial Loss Insurance**

#### **ðŸ”¸ Credit Insurance**

Credit Insurance is a category of financial loss insurance designed to protect a creditor against the risk that debtors will fail to pay what they owe. It provides indemnity against financial losses arising from the non-performance or insolvency of debtors.

This type of cover falls under the broader heading of Financial Loss Insurance, which indemnifies the insured against financial losses from specific causes rather than direct physical damage to property or legal liability to a third party. Most financial loss classes, including credit insurance, are considered **short-tailed**.

##### **1\. Types of Credit Insurance**

The sources identify two principal types of credit insurance:

* **Trade Credit**: This is the main type of credit insurance. It covers a business against uncollectible debts from its customers. Cover can be sold on an annual basis or for the length of a specific project, such as protecting against a customer failing to pay for a ship at the end of its construction.

* **Mortgage Indemnity (or Mortgage Guarantee)**: This is a specific form of credit insurance that protects a mortgage **lender** (the mortgagee) against financial loss if a borrower (the mortgagor) defaults on their loan and the subsequent resale value of the property is insufficient to cover the outstanding debt.

  * **Unusual Feature**: While the lender is the beneficiary of the policy, the premium is often paid by the borrower, especially when the loan-to-value ratio is high (eg, over 75%).  
  * **Long Term**: Unlike most short-tail financial loss products, these policies can have very long terms, often lasting for the entire duration of the mortgage (eg, 25 years), even if paid by a single premium at the outset.

##### **2\. Customer Need and Perils**

The primary customer need met by credit insurance is protection for a creditor against the risk of debtors failing to pay their obligations. The main insured perils are the **non-performance or insolvency of debtors**. For mortgage indemnity specifically, the peril is the borrower defaulting on the loan when the property's value is insufficient to repay the debt.

##### **3\. Claim Characteristics**

* **Tail Length**: Credit risks are generally **short-tailed**.  
* **Economic Sensitivity**: The claims experience for credit insurance is highly dependent on external economic factors.  
  * **Mortgage Indemnity** is a highly cyclical class, with claim experience heavily dependent on interest rates, house prices, and unemployment levels. For instance, higher interest rates and rising unemployment are more likely to lead to defaults on mortgage payments, while falling house prices can lead to negative equity, increasing the insurer's loss upon repossession.

##### **4\. Pricing and Underwriting**

As commercial policies, credit insurance products are individually underwritten based on the nature of the business and the sums at risk.

* **Exposure Measure (Mortgage Indemnity)**: A possible, though imperfect, measure of exposure is the excess of the loan amount over a certain percentage of the property's value, often referred to as the "normal advance".  
* **Rating Factors (Mortgage Indemnity)**: In practice, insurers often do not incorporate the individual borrower's circumstances into the rating structure. Instead, they rely on the lender to be prudent in granting mortgages. The premium rates may be standard for all policies issued through a specific mortgage lender and may also take into account the term of the mortgage. The effect of factors like falling house prices is typically factored into premium rates on a global basis rather than for individual houses.

*Exam Coach Tip: Questions on financial loss products like Credit Insurance frequently test your understanding of their connection to the wider economic environment. When discussing Mortgage Indemnity, always highlight its sensitivity to unemployment, interest rates, and house prices. This demonstrates the commercial awareness required at the SP and SA levels.*
