As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, the structure of the market dictates the strategies employed for acquiring business. Non-London Market (Non-LM) business typically refers to the acquisition of risks outside the highly specialized face-to-face trading environment of the City of London.

The marketing strategies employed in this sphere are characterized by diverse distribution channels, intense price competition, and responsiveness to technological change, especially in personal lines.

## **I. Characteristics and Definition of Non-London Market Business**

The Non-London Market encompasses the large volume of general insurance sold directly to individuals and smaller businesses, contrasted with the specialized, subscription-based London Market (LM), which focuses on large direct risks, international risks, and reinsurance.

Non-London Market business acquisition strategies are concerned primarily with volume, managing distribution costs, and maintaining competitive pricing for standardized retail products.

## **II. Primary Distribution Channels and Acquisition Methods**

Non-London Market business is obtained primarily through three types of distribution channels:

### **1\. Intermediaries**

These organizations act between the seller and buyer of an insurance contract:

* **Brokers:** They are typically paid by **commission** (brokerage) from the insurer, although they are legally the agent of the insured when placing business. Brokers act without being tied to a particular party.  
* **Tied Agents:** This category includes banks and building societies that sell an insurer's products.

### **2\. Direct Staff**

The insurer employs staff who are paid either a fixed salary, commission, or a mixture of both methods.

### **3\. Direct Marketing Methods**

These methods bypass traditional intermediaries and are particularly focused on personal lines and small commercial risks through mass advertising:

* **Internet Sales:** Now the dominant sales channel for personal lines and smaller retail products.  
* **Telesales:** Making direct sales using the telephone.  
* **Post and Off-the-Page Advertising:** Placing advertisements in newspapers, magazines, or phone books.

In the UK, within recent years, there has been an increased attempt to sell insurance directly to the public, avoiding intermediaries altogether, usually through direct mail, phone, or the internet.

## **III. Strategic and Financial Implications of Channel Selection**

The choice and management of these distribution channels are core marketing decisions that affect profitability, expense structure, and risk profile.

### **1\. Expense Management**

Distribution channels carry distinct expense profiles, which influence the final price charged to the consumer:

* **Broker Sales:** Typically have a \*\* high variable cost\*\* (commission is incurred every time a policy is sold) and a **low fixed (setup) cost**. Commissions are usually expressed as a percentage of the premiums payable.  
* **Direct Sales (Internet/Telesales):** Typically incur a **high fixed cost** (e.g., setting up the website) but very little variable cost.  
* **Acquisition Costs:** Where brokerage fees are avoided, direct marketing costs must be balanced against the commission saved. The company may charge different rates for different channels to reflect differing expense levels.

### **2\. Risk Profile and Anti-Selection**

Claims experience, frequency, severity, and development patterns are expected to vary significantly by distribution channel.

* **Fraud Risk:** The lack of face-to-face interaction or a telephone call when buying a policy through direct channels (especially the internet) significantly increases the possibility of **fraud**, which affects claim frequency and severity.  
* **Risk Segmentation:** Policyholders' riskiness may differ by channel due to underlying risk proxies (e.g., an affinity scheme targeting specific groups like classic car enthusiasts).  
* **Underwriting Constraints:** System constraints, particularly in broker systems, might limit the number of rating factors that can be used, potentially leading to less accurate risk pricing in that channel.

## **IV. Technological Disruptors in the Non-London Market**

Technological advancements have revolutionized Non-London Market marketing strategies, particularly in personal lines, heightening competition and complexity.

### **1\. Aggregators (Price Comparison Websites)**

The development of aggregator sites is recognized as a major disruptor to the marketplace, dealing mainly with personal lines business.

* **Pricing Transparency:** Aggregators have resulted in **more transparency** in pricing levels across the market.  
* **Consumer Behavior:** This transparency makes consumers more price sensitive and willing to shop around at renewal.  
* **Adverse Selection Risk:** The increased transparency heightens the risk of **anti-selection** for under-priced segments of a portfolio. If an insurer fails to charge appropriate rates at the individual risk level when competitors are succeeding, lower-risk insureds are likely to leave.  
* **Expense Structure:** Insurers may pay a fee or satisfy certain conditions to be a member of the aggregator panel, and commission arrangements may involve a per policy charge rather than a percentage of written premium.

### **2\. Sophisticated Pricing Models**

The rise in computing power and data quality (data warehouse initiatives) has enabled insurers to adopt sophisticated statistical techniques for pricing Non-LM business:

* **Multivariate Models:** Techniques like Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) have become widespread for personal lines pricing and, to a lesser extent, small commercial risks.  
* **Competitive Advantage:** The widespread adoption of multivariate methods was triggered by **competitive pressure**. When one or more companies implement improved classification ratemaking, they gain a competitive advantage and put the rest of the industry in a position of adverse selection and decreased profitability.  
* **Systematic Pricing:** Companies use pricing models to maximize profitability and maintain market share by calculating the optimal premium for each individual risk, taking into account price elasticity (customer demand models) alongside technical loss costs.

In essence, marketing strategies in the Non-London Market leverage technology and data sophistication (GLMs, optimized pricing) across multiple channels (direct and intermediary) while constantly monitoring key metrics like close ratios and retention rates to adjust prices in response to intense competition and prevent adverse selection.
