This discussion addresses the structure and implications of Direct Sales channels—Staff, Internet, Telesales, and Off-the-page advertising—which form the core marketing strategies within the Non-London Market Business environment, a critical component of the General Business Environment required for SP8.

## **Direct Sales Strategies in Non-London Market Business**

The Non-London Market (Non-LM) focuses predominantly on general insurance provided to individuals (personal lines) and small commercial entities. Direct sales represent the segment of business acquisition that bypasses independent intermediaries, favoring direct contact between the insurer and the policyholder.

### **I. Channels of Direct Sales Acquisition**

In the Non-LM environment, insurance business is obtained through several direct methods:

1. **Staff Directly Employed by the Provider:** Insurers utilize staff employed directly to sell insurance products. These staff may be compensated by a fixed salary, entirely by commission, or, most commonly, by a mixture of these two methods.  
2. **Direct Marketing Methods:** These methods invite potential policyholders to make proposals without relying on traditional face-to-face intermediary interactions:  
   * **Telesales:** Making direct sales using the telephone.  
   * **Internet Sales:** Policyholders are invited to make proposals via the internet. The internet is now recognized as the **dominant sales channel** for personal lines and smaller retail products.  
   * **Post and Off-the-page Advertising:** Potential policyholders are attracted through direct mail or advertising placed in the media, such as newspapers, magazines, or phone books (known as 'off-the-page' advertising).

There has been an increased attempt in recent years in markets like the UK to sell insurance directly to the public, aiming to avoid intermediaries altogether, with the main classes affected being private motor and domestic property.

### **II. Strategic Motivation: Expense and Market Access**

A primary driver for utilizing direct sales is the restructuring of the expense profile and the reduction of acquisition costs.

1. **Fixed vs. Variable Costs:** Different distribution channels carry distinct expense profiles.  
   * **Internet Sales** typically involve a **high fixed cost** (e.g., setting up and testing the website and infrastructure) but **very little variable cost**.  
   * This is contrasted with broker sales, which have high variable costs (commission) but low fixed costs.  
2. **Competitive Pricing:** Selling via the internet should, in theory, lead to **cheaper premium rates** as the ongoing expenses are lower (even though initial development costs are high).

### **III. Implications for Risk, Pricing, and Uncertainty**

The operational mechanics of direct sales introduce significant implications, particularly concerning risk identification and actuarial pricing inputs.

#### **1\. Increased Fraud and Unpredictability**

The nature of direct sales, especially internet transactions, fundamentally alters the interaction with the insured:

* **Lack of Filtering:** The lack of a face-to-face meeting or a telephone call when buying a policy substantially **increases the possibility of fraud**. This affects both the frequency and severity of claims.  
* **Fraudulent Behavior:** Online claims reporting or direct interactions may cause an increase in fraudulent behavior, such as reporting non-existent or exaggerating existing claims, which introduces **additional uncertainty** into the setting of future premiums.

#### **2\. Claim Behavior and Risk Profile**

The channels themselves often carry underlying differences in claims experience:

* **Development Patterns:** Direct sales may be expected to develop claims **more quickly** than broker sales, especially if broker-sourced claims are reported via the broker.  
* **Risk Characteristics:** If a direct acquisition strategy attracts policyholders with different characteristics from the existing clientele (e.g., policyholders attracted by low direct prices might be higher risk), the claims experience may differ unpredictably. The distribution channel itself can manifest as an underlying proxy to risk.

#### **3\. Competitive and Technological Pressure**

The rise of direct sales is intrinsically linked to market disruption:

* **Aggregator Sites:** The development of price comparison websites (aggregators) primarily deals with personal lines and has led to **greater transparency in pricing** across the market.  
* **Anti-Selection Risk:** This increased transparency leads to more instances of **anti-selection** for insurers with under-priced segments, as consumers are more sensitive to price differences and willing to shop around.  
* **Competitive Reaction:** The growth of the direct channel may cause a "knock-on effect" on existing channels, potentially shrinking the broker channel and resulting in brokers offering incentives to attract business, which in turn affects premiums and claims patterns across the market.  
* **Pricing Sophistication:** To manage competitive pricing effectively in the direct market, multivariate classification models like Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) are widely used for personal lines and small commercial risks to ensure premiums are commensurate with individual risk.

### **IV. Marketing and Actuarial Feedback**

Direct sales rely heavily on performance monitoring and strategic adjustments:

* **Monitoring:** Insurers constantly review their selling methods in the quest for improved profitability. This review should extend beyond the number of sales and expenses incurred (commission) to include the **quality of business sold**, measured by claim experience from each sales outlet.  
* **Rate Differentiation:** If a company uses multiple distribution channels for the same class, management must decide whether to charge the same premiums or allow **cross-subsidies** to reflect the different expense levels and competitive environments of each channel. While the technical premium may not be *directly* affected by the distribution channel, differences in acquisition costs or system constraints (e.g., broker systems limiting rating factors) can necessitate final price adjustments.
