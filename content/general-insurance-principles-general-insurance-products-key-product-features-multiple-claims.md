As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note sequence on the concept of **Multiple Claims**, placing it within the larger context of **Key Product Features** that define a general insurance product \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. Understanding this feature is essential as it fundamentally distinguishes general insurance from typical life insurance and has significant implications for pricing, reserving, and risk management \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **The Larger Context: Key Product Features**

When analysing any general insurance product, we examine several key features to understand the risks involved \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The feature of **"Benefits Provided"** is central to this analysis, as it dictates what the insurer pays out \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. A crucial aspect of the benefits provided by most general insurance policies is the potential for multiple claims to be made during the period of cover \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **The Principle of Multiple Claims**

Unlike many life insurance policies where a single claim event (e.g., death) terminates the contract, most general insurance policies allow the insured to claim multiple times during the period of cover, which is typically one year \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This feature is a direct consequence of the policy's purpose: to provide ongoing protection against various perils over a defined period.

**Example: Private Motor Insurance** A policyholder with a comprehensive private motor insurance policy could validly claim multiple times within a single policy year for separate, unrelated incidents, such as:

* A windscreen chip repair in January.  
* Accidental damage from a minor collision in May.  
* Theft of the vehicle in September \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

This potential for multiple claims is a fundamental risk characteristic that actuaries must model and price for.

### **Implications of Multiple Claims on Actuarial Work**

The possibility of multiple claims directly influences several key product features and actuarial investigations:

#### **1\. Claim Characteristics**

The feature of multiple claims means that the **Claim Frequency** for a policy or a portfolio is a critical variable. It is not a simple binary outcome (claim or no claim) but can be a count of 0, 1, 2, or more claims per policy period.

* **Modelling:** This necessitates the use of statistical distributions that can model claim counts, such as the Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. These models are central to the **frequency-severity approach** to pricing, where the pure risk premium is calculated as: `Expected Claim Frequency Ã— Expected Claim Severity` \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Data Requirements:** To accurately model frequency, the insurer's data system must be able to handle multiple claim records linked to a single policy and distinguish between them \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The system must cope with the possibility of multiple claims or claimants for a single policy.

#### **2\. Risk Factors and Experience Rating**

The history of multiple claims is a powerful indicator of future risk. Insurers use this information to adjust premiums, most commonly through **No-Claim Discount (NCD)** systems \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **NCD Systems:** These are a form of prospective experience rating where a policyholder's premium is discounted based on their recent claims history \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. A driver with multiple claims will typically lose their discount and face a higher renewal premium, reflecting the insurer's updated assessment of their risk profile \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

#### **3\. Policy Conditions and Limits**

To manage the financial risk posed by multiple claims, insurers embed specific features into the policy:

* **Reinstatements (for Non-Proportional Reinsurance):** On the reinsurance side, the risk of multiple large claims impacting a single excess of loss treaty is managed through **reinstatements**. After a claim exhausts some or all of the reinsurance layer, a reinstatement premium may be required to restore the cover, allowing it to respond to subsequent claims. The number of reinstatements is often limited \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Aggregate Limits:** Some policies may include an **annual aggregate limit**, which caps the total amount the insurer will pay for all claims within a single policy year. This is a direct control on the risk of multiple claims \[SP7.pdf\].

#### **4\. The Individual vs. Collective Risk Model**

The concept of multiple claims is a key differentiator between the two primary aggregate claim distribution models:

* **Individual Risk Model:** This model assumes that each risk (policy) can generate a maximum of one claim. This is a significant restriction and makes it unsuitable for most general insurance applications where multiple claims are possible.  
* **Collective Risk Model:** This model is more appropriate for general insurance as it models the aggregate claims from a portfolio by considering a random number of claims (`N`), where `N` can be greater than one, and the severity of each of those `N` claims. It does not restrict the number of claims that can arise from an individual policy.

In summary, the possibility of **Multiple Claims** is a defining product feature of general insurance. It fundamentally shapes the actuarial approach to pricing and risk modelling, necessitating the use of frequency-severity models and experience rating systems like NCD. It also drives the inclusion of specific policy and reinsurance terms, such as aggregate limits and reinstatements, to control the insurer's total exposure over the policy period.
