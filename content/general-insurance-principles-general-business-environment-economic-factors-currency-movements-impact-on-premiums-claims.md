As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, the consideration of **Currency Movements** is a mandatory element when analyzing the external economic factors impacting general insurers, particularly those with international portfolios (Syllabus Objective 1.3). Changes in exchange rates introduce volatility that directly affects claim costs, premium adequacy assessments, and solvency.

Here is a structured discussion detailing the impact of currency movements on premiums and claims:

## **I. Impact on Claims Severity and Uncertainty**

Currency risk primarily affects claims by introducing uncertainty regarding the ultimate cost and the currency of payment, which, in turn, impacts claims severity.

1. **Uncertainty of Settlement Currency:** For business transacted in a currency other than the insurer's domestic currency, there is risk that the insurer's results will be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate. It is often **impossible to predict the currency** in which a claim will have to be settled.  
2. **Classes Highly Exposed:** While most small or medium-sized insurers have limited exposure (perhaps only a few overseas claims, like those from travel insurance), larger international companies, the London Market, and reinsurance companies are heavily exposed due to writing business across multiple territories. Specific classes where claims may be incurred in a country or currency different from the policy issuance include commercial property, marine insurance, private motor, and travel insurance.  
3. **Cost Inflation:** If claims are eventually paid in a foreign currency that has appreciated against the insurer's home currency, the actual cost of those claims, when measured in the home currency, will be higher.

## **II. Distortion of Financial Results and Premium Setting**

Currency fluctuations can artificially distort profitability figures, necessitating care when using historical accounts data to set future premiums.

1. **Reported Loss Distortion:** If an insurer writes a policy in a foreign currency that subsequently **appreciates** against its home currency, the claims will cost more when measured in the home currency. This can lead to a policy that was profitable in its original currency appearing to have been sold at a **loss** in the insurer’s published (domestic currency) accounts.  
2. **Pricing Decision:** This apparent loss is due to exchange rate movements, not poor pricing or adverse claims experience. Therefore, this distortion **should not be used as a reason to increase premiums**. Actuaries must be careful to distinguish between losses resulting from underwriting inadequacy and losses resulting from financial market volatility.  
3. **Capital and Solvency Impact:** Adverse currency movements represent a form of market risk, which can cause movements in asset values and potentially **jeopardise an insurer’s solvency**. Furthermore, a mismatch between the reporting currency of an insurer and the majority of their liabilities can **increase the capital requirements** necessary to reflect the currency mismatch.

## **III. Challenges in Actuarial Data Analysis**

Currency movements complicate the accurate preparation of historical claims data required for ratemaking and reserving.

1. **Distortion of Claims Data Triangles:** Currency movements can distort development factors when underlying claims data in a triangle is converted to the home currency at different rates of exchange over time. This makes the resultant development factors unreliable for projecting future claim patterns.  
2. **Actuarial Adjustment:** To remove this distortion, the actuarial analysis of historical loss data is usually carried out with all data **converted at current exchange rates**. This ensures that the technical analysis of frequency and severity trends is not corrupted by spurious financial effects.  
3. **Judgement in Analysis:** Judgement must be used in deciding how exchange rates should be applied in any analysis, especially in international industries where a single currency (e.g., the US dollar for oil or aerospace claims) may dominate worldwide, even if the policy or local payment is made in a different currency.

## **IV. Mitigation via Investment Strategy**

To mitigate currency risk, insurers adopt specific investment and hedging practices to match assets and liabilities.

1. **Currency Matching:** A basic assumption is that an international insurer should hold assets in currencies that can **match its liabilities**. This strategy ensures that the value of both assets and liabilities move together, allowing exchange gains on one to offset losses on the other.  
2. **Hedging:** A similar offsetting effect might be achieved through a **currency-hedging strategy**, potentially utilizing forward currency contracts.  
3. **Practical Limitations:** It is not possible to match currency precisely because it is often unknown in advance in which currencies claims will arise, and reserves may run-off favorably in one currency and unfavorably in another. Furthermore, even a well-matched portfolio can show losses if the home currency strengthens, making foreign currency profits and capital worth less in the domestic accounting terms.
