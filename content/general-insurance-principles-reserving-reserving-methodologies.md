Reserving is arguably the bedrock of general insurance actuarial work. It's where we quantify the financial obligations an insurer has to its policyholders, both for claims that have already occurred and for those that are yet to manifest. Mastering reserving isn't just about crunching numbers; it's about applying astute actuarial judgement, understanding the inherent uncertainties, and effectively communicating your findings.

The SP7 syllabus dedicates a substantial portion to reserving, spanning several chapters:

* **Chapter 14: Reserving Bases** – Guiding your foundational assumptions.  
* **Chapter 15: Triangulation Methods** – Your statistical toolkit for estimating reserves.  
* **Chapter 16: Stochastic Reserving Models** – Quantifying the inevitable uncertainty.  
* **Chapter 17: Assessment of Reserving Results** – Validating your conclusions.  
* **Chapter 18: Reserving – Use of Ranges and Best Estimates** – Presenting a complete picture.

Today, we'll delve deep into the methodologies, drawing heavily from Chapters 14, 15, and 16\.

### **1\. Reserving: The Foundational Pillar of General Insurance**

At its core, reserving involves estimating the liabilities of a general insurer. This isn't a static calculation; it's a dynamic process fraught with uncertainty, especially for longer-tailed classes of business. Your ability to navigate this uncertainty is paramount.

#### **1.1 Reasons for Calculating Reserves**

Why do we spend so much time on these calculations? The purpose of the reserving exercise is a primary determinant of your chosen methodology and assumptions. Here are the key reasons \[14.2(i), 324-325\]:

* **Published Accounts**: To present a true and fair view of the insurer's financial position to shareholders, often on a "going concern" basis. This may require a prudent best estimate or a discounted basis, depending on the accounting standards (e.g., IFRS 4, IFRS 17, UK GAAP).  
* **Supervision of Solvency**: To demonstrate to regulatory authorities (like IRDAI in India or Solvency II in Europe) that the company can meet its obligations to policyholders. This often demands a highly prudent basis or a best estimate with explicit risk margins.  
* **Internal Management Purposes**: To provide management with a realistic view of the business for performance monitoring, strategic decision-making, and assessing profitability by area. A best estimate basis is typically preferred here, often accompanied by sensitivity testing.  
* **Valuation for Sale or Purchase (M\&A)**: When an insurer is being bought or sold, both parties need to assess the adequacy of booked reserves. The purchaser usually takes a more pessimistic view than the vendor due to commercial implications.  
* **Negotiating Commutations**: To determine the cost of settling future liabilities from a specific block of business, often considering reinsurance recoveries and financial strength.  
* **Transfer of Liabilities (e.g., Part VII transfers)**: Similar to M\&A, but with specific regulatory considerations to ensure "arm's length" transactions within a group.  
* **Ascertaining Tax Liabilities**: Reserves may differ from published accounts due to specific tax regulations. Over-reserving could lead to penalties.  
* **Testing Adequacy of Case Estimates**: Comparing actual run-off against previous estimates to assess their accuracy.  
* **Estimating Claims Costs for Premium Rating**: Although more relevant to SP8, reserving provides critical inputs into the pricing process.

#### **1.2 Reserving Bases: Defining Your Assumptions**

A "reserving basis" encompasses the methodology and assumptions chosen for a reserving exercise. The selection of an appropriate basis hinges on the purpose of the investigation and the quality/extent of available data.

##### **1.2.1 Factors Influencing the Choice of Basis**

Key factors to consider include \[14.1, 331\]:

* **Purpose of the valuation**: As discussed above, this is paramount.  
* **Class of business**: Long-tail (e.g., liability) versus short-tail (e.g., motor property damage) classes have different uncertainties and data characteristics \[314, 15.1\].  
* **Size of the solvency margin**: A company with substantial margins might be more relaxed about using less strong bases.  
* **Quality, amount, and stability of data**: Inadequate or volatile data necessitates different approaches.

##### **1.2.2 Key Assumptions and Considerations**

* **Allowance for Future Inflation**:

  * All elements of reserves should account for future cost escalation, either implicitly or explicitly.  
  * **Implicit**: Some methods (e.g., basic chain ladder) assume future inflation mirrors past average inflation.  
  * **Explicit**: Inflation-adjusted methods allow actuaries to explicitly factor in expected future inflation, which is crucial if it's anticipated to differ from historical trends.  
  * **Types of Inflation**: For property claims, price and building cost inflation are key; for liability claims, earnings inflation and "social inflation" (increasing generosity in court awards) are vital. Relevant indices can be sourced externally or developed internally.  
  * **Communication**: Clearly state the "force" or "direction" of inflation (origin year vs. calendar year) and what it represents (average claim size increase vs. burning cost per exposure unit).  
* **Discounting for Investment Income**:

  * Discounting allows for the time value of money and expected future investment income from assets backing the liabilities.  
  * **Regulatory Requirements**: Under Solvency II and IFRS 17, reserves *are required* to be discounted. This is a significant shift from past practices where implicit discounting (through prudent margins) was common.  
  * **Discount Rate Selection**: This is a critical actuarial judgement \[14.6, 333\]. Factors include:  
    * Assets backing the technical reserves for the class.  
    * Expected annual rate of return from these assets over the term of liabilities.  
    * Consistency with inflation assumptions.  
    * Allowance for taxation (gross vs. net of tax).  
    * Removal of prudence from the estimated reserve if explicit allowance for contingencies is made elsewhere.  
    * Currency of liabilities and the risk-free yield curve at the valuation date.  
  * **Challenges**: Determining the appropriate discount rate can be difficult, but not insurmountable.  
* **Granularity of Reserves**: Reserves can be calculated at different levels:

  * **Class Level**: More aggregated, common for statistical methods.  
  * **Individual Policy/Claim Level**: More granular, often used for large, complex claims or for case estimates.  
* **Communication of the Reserving Basis**: Clarity is key. You must enable the audience (management, regulators, auditors) to understand your rationale and the reasonableness of your assumptions. This includes:

  * Focussing on significant issues given the purpose.  
  * Explaining what's included/excluded in the best estimate (e.g., allocated/unallocated loss adjustment expenses, net/gross of reinsurance/salvage/subrogation, bad debt).  
  * Emphasising unusual issues.  
  * Commenting within the context and scope of the exercise.  
  * Avoiding misunderstandings and defining terms carefully (e.g., "best estimate," sources of uncertainty like process, parameter, model, and specification/selection error).  
  * Stating material assumptions and their rationale, along with any significant limitations of models or data.

### **2\. Triangulation Methods: Your Statistical Workhorses (Chapter 15\)**

Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty of the quantitative tools. Triangulation methods are fundamental to general insurance reserving. While you might be familiar with the mechanics from earlier subjects, SP7 focuses on the underlying principles and the impact of data distortions.

#### **2.1 General Issues Affecting Reserving Work Using Triangulations**

Before applying any method, a good actuary understands the data's nuances.

* **Understanding the Data**: Triangulation methods are imperfect representations of the overall claims process. It's vital to understand data limitations, strengths, and weaknesses to select appropriate methods and group data effectively.  
* **Data Grouping and Heterogeneity**:  
  * **Underwriting Year vs. Accident Year vs. Reporting Year**: Different grouping bases for claims data have implications for how IBNR, recoveries, and re-opened claims are captured. Underwriting year offers a comprehensive view for policy-related profitability, while accident year tracks claims by occurrence date, and reporting year by date of notification.  
  * **Development Periods**: Quarterly versus annual development factors. While quarterly is often needed for management reports, annual periods can help identify broader trends less susceptible to short-term volatility.  
  * **Homogeneity vs. Credibility**: Data should be grouped into homogenous cells (e.g., by class of business, claim development patterns, size of loss, legal environment). However, cells shouldn't be so fine that data becomes too sparse to be credible. Materiality also guides grouping – small classes might need pragmatic approaches.  
* **Treatment of Large Losses and Non-Standard Risks**:  
  * **Distorting Effect**: Large or unusual claims (e.g., catastrophes, latent claims) can significantly distort standard triangulation methods due to their different frequency, severity, and development patterns compared to "attritional" claims.  
  * **Separate Analysis**: It's often necessary to analyse these separately, either by truncating them (capping at a limit) or removing them altogether from the main triangles. Actuaries then project them individually or using specific models.  
  * **Exposure-Based Methods**: For large losses or new books of business where historical data is sparse, exposure-based methods (e.g., bottom-up: policy-by-policy assessment; top-down: overall exposure and benchmark factors) can be employed.  
  * **Catastrophe Models**: These are tools used to assess likely losses from natural catastrophes, more commonly for pricing but can inform reserving for CAT events.  
* **Latent Claims**: Claims like asbestos, pollution, and health hazards (APH) are particularly challenging because their emergence pattern is highly uncertain and influenced by calendar year effects (e.g., media publicity) rather than typical development patterns. Standard triangulation methods are generally unsuitable; exposure-based methods are often used.  
* **Basis on Which Business Is Written**: Understanding whether policies are written on a "losses occurring," "claims made," or "risks attaching" basis is crucial, as it impacts how claims relate to policy periods and influences reserving difficulty. Claims-made is often cited as more difficult to reserve for.  
* **Changes in Procedures/Environment**:  
  * **Internal Changes**: Shifts in claims handling (e.g., online portals, new procedures, reserving philosophy) can distort historical development patterns. Actuarial judgement is needed to adjust for these.  
  * **Market-Wide Initiatives**: Collective industry responses to specific issues can also impact reporting and settlement patterns.  
  * **External Environment**: Economic (inflation, interest rates), legal (court awards, legislation), and technical (new products, hazards) changes continually influence claims experience and require careful consideration and adjustment.  
* **Application of Actuarial Judgement**: This cannot be overstated. Reserving is not a mechanical process. Judgement is required to select methods, adjust for distortions, assess reasonableness, and interpret results in light of all available information and experience. Diagnostics (discussed in Chapter 17\) aid this judgement.

#### **2.2 Specific Triangulation Methods**

Let's explore the core techniques in your toolkit.

##### **2.2.1 Chain Ladder (Link Ratio) Method**

The chain ladder method is a cornerstone of reserving, producing a single best estimate of reserves.

* **Description**: It projects future claims development based on historical "link ratios" (development factors) derived from run-off triangles (e.g., paid or incurred claims). It assumes that historical claims development patterns will continue into the future.  
* **Assumptions**: Ideally applied to homogenous and consistent data, with similar reporting, settlement, and inflationary characteristics across origin periods, and sufficient volume for credibility.  
* **Issues**:  
  * **Negative Increments**: Can be problematic for some variations of the method (e.g., log-normal models).  
  * **Changes in Case Reserving Procedures**: Can distort incurred triangles, necessitating a careful comparison between paid and incurred projections.  
  * **Unusually Heavy/Light Experience**: Extreme experience in a year can lead to over or underestimation if a mechanical application of development factors is used. This often calls for methods like Bornhuetter-Ferguson for less developed years.  
  * **Subrogation and Recoveries**: If triangles are constructed net of recoveries, link ratios might be less than one, impacting projections. It's generally recommended to calculate ceded reserves separately.  
* **Inflation Adjusted Chain Ladder**: This variant explicitly allows for future claims inflation, addressing a key limitation of the basic chain ladder which assumes past inflation patterns continue. The choice of index is crucial for its success.

##### **2.2.2 Expected Loss Ratio Method**

This is a simpler, top-down approach.

* **Description**: It estimates future claims by applying a historical or assumed loss ratio to current or projected premiums. It's a simplistic approach, serving as a useful reference point.  
* **Uses**: Particularly useful when data is sparse, unreliable, or missing (e.g., for a new line of business). It's a quick way to check other methods.  
* **Disadvantages**: Relies heavily on the assumption that the chosen loss ratio is correct. It can be subjective, especially if based on "soft" information like underwriter opinion, and may not account for differing rates between new and renewed business.

##### **2.2.3 Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) Method**

The BF method offers a blend of experience and expectation.

* **Description**: It's a credibility-weighted estimate, combining an initial expected ultimate claim amount (often from a loss ratio method) with a projection based on actual experience to date (like a chain ladder projection). It can be applied to both paid or incurred claims.  
* **Application**: The method estimates the proportion of claims already incurred/paid, and then applies the complement to the initial expected ultimate to derive the undeveloped/unpaid portion. The *reserve* is then derived by deducting paid-to-date amounts.  
* **Uses**: Extremely useful when available data for a particular cohort is sparse, especially for more recent years, longer-tailed portfolios, or volatile business lines. It provides stability where chain ladder might be too volatile due to limited data.

##### **2.2.4 Average Cost Per Claim (ACPC) Method**

This method focuses on the components of claims.

* **Description**: Instead of aggregate claims, ACPC models claim frequency (number of claims) and average claim severity (average cost per claim) separately, then combines them to project ultimate claims.  
* **Uses**: Particularly effective when features in the data aggregate modelling methods might miss (e.g., distinguishing whether inflation is driven by claim frequency or severity).  
* **Technical Considerations**: Requires careful allowance for large claims (often excluded/capped and modelled separately), acceleration/slowing of payments, and consistency with industry benchmarks for average claim size. Can introduce cross-subsidies between origin years if not applied carefully.  
* **Strengths**: Easy to understand and communicate, provides granular information (frequency/severity), works well for volatile data (small number of claims), can be used with other methods (chain ladder, BF), and is useful for estimating latent claims by allowing explicit assumptions on claim size, inflation, and number of claims.  
* **Weaknesses**: Susceptible to payment acceleration/slowing and requires careful adjustment for large losses.

#### **2.3 Comparison of Results from Different Methods**

It is generally advisable to use more than one method to project reserves, especially if data permits.

* **Divergence**: Understand what drives the outcome of each method, look for inconsistencies (e.g., paid vs. incurred projections), and ensure trends across cohorts are sensible.  
* **Selection**: The final chosen result might be the method that best reflects the underlying behaviour of claims, or a weighted average of several methods (e.g., Benktander method).

#### **2.4 Reserves for Unexpired Policies**

Beyond outstanding claims, actuaries also need to consider future liabilities from policies for which premiums have already been received.

* **Unearned Premium Reserve (UPR)**: The portion of premiums received that relates to unexpired cover, often calculated on a time basis (e.g., 24ths method).  
* **Unexpired Risk Reserve (URR)**: A prospective assessment of the amount needed to cover claims and expenses from the unexpired risks. This is a forward-looking view.  
* **Additional Unexpired Risk Reserve (AURR)**: The excess of URR over UPR, subject to a minimum of zero. If AURR is non-zero, it suggests that business has been written on unprofitable terms.

#### **2.5 Recoveries**

Reserves for solvency and published accounts are typically presented *net* of recoveries.

* **Types of Recoveries**: Salvage (e.g., selling scrap from motor vehicles) and subrogation (recovering costs from other liable parties), and reinsurance recoveries.  
* **Separate Projection**: Salvage and subrogation should ideally be projected separately from gross amounts due to different payment patterns.  
* **Reinsurance Recoveries**: Can be a significant proportion of gross reserves. While net triangles are possible, it's generally recommended to calculate ceded reserves separately and subtract them from gross reserves, especially for non-proportional (XL) reinsurance where the relationship between gross and net is complex. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is often used for less developed reinsurance years. Chapter 25 (Reinsurance Reserving) discusses this in more detail.

### **3\. Stochastic Reserving Models: Embracing Uncertainty (Chapter 16\)**

The traditional methods, while vital for best estimates, don't tell us about the *range* of possible outcomes or the *likelihood* of actual claims deviating from our point estimate. This is where stochastic reserving comes in – a crucial area for SP7.

#### **3.1 Uses of Stochastic Reserving**

In recent years, the growing interest in reserve uncertainty has pushed stochastic methods to the forefront. Their uses include:

* **Assessing Reserve Adequacy**: Providing information on the strength of reserves, including precautionary margins (explicit or implicit).  
* **Quantifying Uncertainty**: Providing a confidence interval around the best estimate.  
* **Input for Capital Models**: Stochastic reserving techniques are commonly used to determine quantitative estimates of reserve volatility, which is a key input for capital models (e.g., Solvency II's SCR calculation).  
* **Comparing Estimates and Datasets**: Facilitates comparison of reasonableness across different sets of reserve estimates or across different valuation dates.  
* **Monitoring Performance**: Useful for ongoing performance monitoring.  
* **Pricing**: Although implicitly, understanding reserve volatility can impact pricing decisions.

#### **3.2 Drawbacks of Stochastic Reserving**

Despite the benefits, stochastic methods come with challenges:

* **Time and Skill Intensive**: Requires more time, higher levels of skill and training.  
* **Complexity**: Methods are more complicated, increasing risk of mistakes and harder to explain to non-technical audiences.  
* **Judgement**: A considerable element of judgement is required in model choice and parameter selection (especially for Bayesian methods).  
* **Spurious Accuracy**: Sophisticated methods can lead to false confidence if not applied carefully.

#### **3.3 Sources of Reserving Uncertainty**

Understanding the different types of uncertainty is critical for effective stochastic modelling.

* **Process Uncertainty**: The inherent randomness in the actual claims experience.

  * **External Sources**: Uncertainty in the amount, frequency, and timing of individual claims.  
  * **Internal Sources**: Changes in business mix, differences between booked and best estimate reserves, commission/expense uncertainty, new markets, or changes in claims handling.  
  * **Demand Surge**: Post-catastrophe surge in claims or costs.  
  * **Examples**: A new type of claim emerging for product liability, or a major catastrophe for a commercial fire portfolio. Process uncertainty can be small for large, independent portfolios (e.g., personal motor) but significant for small books of high-risk business.  
* **Parameter Uncertainty**: Uncertainty arising from errors in estimating the parameters of the statistical model.

  * **Data Issues**: Poor quality, inconsistent, or limited historical data.  
  * **Example**: Errors in estimated development factors or assumed loss ratios.  
* **Model Error (or Model Uncertainty)**: Arises because actuarial models are simplifications of complex (and unknown) underlying systems, and the chosen model may not fully reflect all features.

  * **Example**: The chain ladder model not allowing for calendar year effects. This means the model's output distribution might not fully represent the true underlying distribution of claims.  
* **(Other)**: The sources also refer to "Specification error" (choice of model form) and "Selection error" (choice of parameters within the model), which can be grouped under Model and Parameter Uncertainty respectively.

#### **3.4 Types of Stochastic Models**

Stochastic reserving models are broadly categorised into:

* **Analytical Methods**: Stochastic element incorporated directly into formulae or statistical distributions. No additional statistical calculations needed. Examples: Mack, ODP, Negative Binomial, Merz-Wüthrich.  
* **Simulation Methods**: Use techniques like Monte Carlo or bootstrapping to obtain predictive distributions of reserves. Provide sufficient information (percentile tables, frequency plots) to communicate results. Example: Bootstrapped ODP.  
* **Bayesian Methods**: Use a prior distribution (capturing beliefs) for input parameters to derive a posterior distribution for the results.

#### **3.5 Specific Stochastic Models**

Let's look at the key models you'll encounter.

##### **3.5.1 Mack Model**

* **Description**: An analytical method that uses a framework similar to the chain ladder. It produces an estimate of the mean and variance of the reserves, but does not specify the precise distribution. It focuses on estimating "prediction error" (process and estimation error combined).  
* **Key Assumptions**:  
  * The run-off pattern is the same for each origin period.  
  * Incremental claim amounts are statistically independent.  
  * The variance of incremental claim amounts is proportional to the mean.  
  * Incremental claims are positive for all development periods. This is a limitation, as negative increments (e.g., from salvage) are common in practice.

##### **3.5.2 Over-dispersed Poisson (ODP) Model**

* **Description**: A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) applied to claims triangles. Its form is chosen such that the mean (best estimate) reserve equals that from a deterministic basic chain ladder method. The key feature is "over-dispersion," meaning the variance of claims is greater than the mean (Variance \= $\\phi \\times$ Mean, where $\\phi \> 1$).  
* **Bootstrapping the ODP**: This is a widely used simulation technique for the ODP model due to its relative simplicity in spreadsheets.  
  * **Process**:  
    1. **Calculate Expected Values and Residuals**: Fit a model (e.g., chain ladder) to historical data to get "back-fitted" expected values. The differences between actual and fitted values are the residuals, which capture the random component.  
    2. **Re-sample Residuals**: Sample (with replacement) from these residuals to create numerous "pseudo-data sets" (alternative past data sets).  
    3. **Re-fit and Project**: Apply the same reserving method (e.g., chain ladder) to each pseudo-data set to obtain a distribution of possible reserve estimates.  
  * **Rationale**: It's called "bootstrapping the ODP" because, even though it looks like sampling from a chain ladder, the process effectively replicates the over-dispersed nature of the data consistent with the ODP model.  
  * **Benefits**: Can derive the full distribution of the Claims Development Result (CDR) for future years and allow for tail factors. Also known as the "re-reserving" approach.

##### **3.5.3 Merz-Wüthrich Formula**

* **Description**: An analytical approach to estimate reserve uncertainty over a *one-year* time horizon, specifically the Claims Development Result (CDR). It uses the same assumptions as the Mack model but is focused on the shorter one-year view.

#### **3.6 Issues Surrounding Stochastic Reserving**

Even with these powerful tools, challenges remain.

* **Model Forms and Data Mismatches**: Some models (e.g., log-normal) may struggle with negative increments in data (common for incurred claims or large recoveries), limiting their applicability.  
* **Latent Claims**: Standard stochastic methods are generally unsuitable for latent claims (like APH) as they rely on past data which doesn't fully capture the long-term, uncertain development of such claims. This often leads to an underestimation of variability. Exposure-based methods are usually more appropriate here.  
* **Sparse Data and Peculiarities**: Like deterministic methods, stochastic models can be problematic with sparse datasets or data peculiarities, as small changes can significantly alter the distribution of outcomes. Actuarial judgement is crucial to handle such situations, possibly using stress testing to identify the extent of the problem.  
* **The Extremes (Tail Behaviour)**: Stochastic models are often used to estimate extreme tails of distributions (e.g., for capital modelling). However, parameterization from finite historical data may not accurately represent these tails, and simplifying assumptions can break down at the extremes. Extreme caution is needed when estimating high percentiles.  
* **Underestimation of Variability**: A consensus exists that many stochastic methods (e.g., Mack, bootstrapping) tend to underestimate the *true* underlying variability of reserves. This is because historical data may not capture all future sources of variability (e.g., changes in discount rates like Ogden, one-off court judgments, prolonged high inflation). Judgement is essential to avoid blindly accepting model outputs.

#### **3.7 Stochastic Reserving in Practice**

* **Validation**: Assessing the reasonableness and validity of results is an essential stage before communicating them. This involves applying judgement and experience.  
* **Validation Approaches**: Reconciliation with deterministic results, graphical review, high-level reasonableness checks, comparison against benchmarks, back-testing, and applying stress/scenario tests are common.  
* **Communication**: Scenario-based approaches are gaining traction for communicating uncertainty as they offer more tangible illustrations than raw stochastic distributions.

#### **3.8 Alternative Approaches to Stochastic Reserving**

* **Bayesian Approach**:  
  * **Description**: Combines a "prior distribution" (your beliefs about the exposure) with the "likelihood" (probabilities from past claims data) to produce a "posterior distribution" (reflecting both beliefs and data).  
  * **Advantages**: Provides a *complete predictive distribution* of ultimate reserves, allowing for calculation of confidence intervals, quantiles, and probabilities of extreme values. It explicitly states the subjective judgement through the prior.  
  * **Disadvantages**: The choice of prior distribution is subjective and can heavily influence the posterior distribution, potentially leading to over-reliance. Numerical integration (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo \- MCMC) may be needed if a simple "closed-form" solution isn't available.  
* **Other Methods (for sparse data or new business)**:  
  * In situations with no past claims data (e.g., new lines of business), actuaries may use cedant or market figures, reinsurers' expertise, or even policy limits (for upper bounds).  
  * A Bayesian credibility approach can incorporate emerging experience into initial estimates as data becomes available.

#### **3.9 Aggregation Across Multiple Lines of Business and Correlations**

From a company's overall financial perspective, an aggregate distribution covering all lines of business is needed.

* **Simulation for Aggregation**: Simulation methods are generally simpler for aggregating across lines of business than analytical methods. After simulating each line, results can be summed.  
* **Crucial Role of Dependencies/Correlations**: When aggregating, it's *critical* to account for dependencies (correlations) between lines of business. Ignoring positive correlations (which are common in general insurance) will lead to an *underestimation* of the aggregate variability.  
* **Methods for Incorporating Dependencies**:  
  * **Linking Assumptions**: Explicitly linking assumptions through formulae (e.g., claims inflation as a margin over price inflation).  
  * **Correlation Matrices**: Used to define correlations between different risks or lines of business.  
  * **Copulas**: More advanced statistical tools (e.g., Gaussian, t, Gumbel, Clayton copulas) that build multivariate distributions to represent underlying variable dependencies, especially important for tail correlations.  
* **Challenge of Parameterisation**: It can be difficult to parameterise these dependencies from historical data, making actuarial judgement in this area extremely important.
