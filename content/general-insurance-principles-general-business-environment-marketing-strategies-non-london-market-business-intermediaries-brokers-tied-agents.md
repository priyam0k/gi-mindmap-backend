As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, understanding the function and implications of intermediaries in the Non-London Market (Non-LM) is crucial, as this dictates distribution strategy, expense profiles, and data qualityâ€”all fundamental to accurate pricing.

Here is a structured discussion of Intermediaries (Brokers and Tied Agents) within the Non-London Market Business context, synthesized from the sources:

---

## **I. Defining Intermediaries in the Non-London Market**

Non-London Market business refers to insurance acquired outside the specialized face-to-face subscription system, primarily targeted at individuals and smaller commercial risks. Intermediaries are a core acquisition channel in this environment.

### **1\. Brokers**

Brokers act as independent intermediaries between the seller (insurer) and the buyer (insured) of a contract, without being tied exclusively to either party.

* **Agency Role:** When placing business, brokers are legally considered the **agent of the insured**. However, when performing certain functions on behalf of the insurer (such as operating binding authorities or line slips), they are legally agents of the insurer.  
* **Market Intelligence:** In sophisticated, less regulated markets where rate manuals may not be readily available, companies often rely on obtaining competitive price information from brokers.

### **2\. Tied Agents**

Tied agents include institutions such as banks and building societies.

* **Exclusivity:** These agents are sometimes tied to a particular insurer (which may be part of the same group) and sell that insurer's products. Importantly, the sale of a specific line of business (e.g., motor policies) through a tied agent is exclusive to one insurer, although they may sell different lines from other insurers (e.g., property policies from Insurer B).  
* **Class Relevance:** The specific type of intermediary used often depends on the class of business (e.g., buildings insurance or mortgage guarantee are commonly sold through the bank or building society providing the mortgage).

## **II. Financial and Expense Implications of Intermediaries**

Intermediaries represent a significant cost component that must be factored into premium rates.

### **1\. Compensation Structure**

* **Commission/Brokerage:** Brokers and tied agents are typically paid by **commission** (or brokerage) from the insurer as compensation for generating business. This is usually expressed as a percentage of the premium written.  
* **Expense Profile:** Sales acquired via brokers typically exhibit a **high variable cost** (due to commissions incurred per policy sold) but a relatively **low fixed (setup) cost** for the insurer.

### **2\. Expense Uncertainty**

* **Mix Changes:** Uncertainty over the future **mix of sales** (by class, distribution channel, or broker) can increase the average commission rate if a higher proportion of business is sold on higher commission terms, adding uncertainty to expense estimation.  
* **Administrative Relief:** While commission is a cost, the **ongoing expenses may be reduced** if the broker or agent assumes responsibility for administrative tasks (e.g., endorsements and dealing with claims). The commission paid often reflects the extent of this involvement.

## **III. Operational Challenges and Data Inconsistencies**

The involvement of external intermediaries introduces complications in data collection, processing speed, and consistency, which directly affects actuarial pricing inputs.

### **1\. Administrative Delegation**

Brokers and agents vary greatly in the specific roles they play in sales, administration, and claims processes.

* **Claims Involvement:** Some brokers retain funds to pay straightforward claims on behalf of the insurer, while others are not involved in claims administration at all.  
* **Information Transfer (Bordereaux):** Brokers and agents provide claims details to the insurer either for staff entry or via **bordereaux** (detailed lists of premiums, claims, and statistics).

### **2\. Data Quality and Limitations**

Delegating functions to intermediaries presents specific data challenges:

* **Summary Data:** When large parts of business are obtained through intermediaries, the insurer may receive **summarized data**. Premiums and claims information might be bulk figures, making underlying policy and claim details hard to access.  
* **Inconsistency and Delay:** The data provided by different brokers and agents can vary in format and quality. Information might be provided on paper, requiring time-consuming manual entry by the insurer's staff. Delays mean that only major losses may be broken out from claims bordereaux, with the residual entered as a bulk item.  
* **System Constraints:** Broker systems (portals) may impose **system constraints** that limit the number of rating factors available to the insurer for calculating the risk premium, potentially undermining the accuracy afforded by the insurer's advanced modeling capabilities.

## **IV. Strategic Implications for Pricing and Risk Management**

Intermediaries are integral to market strategy, acting as both distributors and risk/profit differentiators.

### **1\. Market Penetration and Segmentation**

The choice of intermediary determines access to specific market segments. Different channels provide access to different volumes and segments (e.g., large commercial risks via specialist brokers vs. homeowners via mortgage providers).

### **2\. Managing Adverse Selection**

* **Risk Proxy:** The distribution channel itself can act as an **underlying proxy to risk**, meaning the "riskiness" of policyholders may differ significantly depending on the channel. This must be monitored to ensure rates are appropriate for the channel.  
* **Profitability Analysis:** Insurers conduct actuarial investigations to measure **persistency and profitability by source** (broker, agent, direct). This analysis helps detect and avoid **adverse selection**, allowing the insurer to devise appropriate incentive or commission schemes to attract profitable business and avoid less profitable sources.

### **3\. Pricing Decisions and Negotiation**

* **Relationship Management:** Insurers may adjust pricing structures (e.g., "tweak prices") to favor a particular broker's target market, especially if that broker consistently delivers a large volume of profitable business. This is a common practice influenced by the relationship with the distributor.  
* **Cross-Subsidies:** If a company uses multiple distribution channels for the same class of business, management must decide whether to charge the same premiums across all channels or allow cross-subsidies to manage competition and expenses.  
* **Competitive Intelligence:** In highly competitive markets, brokers are a source of competitive price information which informs the insurer's own pricing strategy.
