Excellent question. Designing proposal and claim forms is a critical, practical aspect of fulfilling an insurer's information system requirements. These forms are the primary data capture tools, and their design directly impacts the quality and reliability of the data that feeds the entire system, which in turn underpins all actuarial pricing and reserving analysis.

Let's build a structured note on what the sources say about proposal and claim form design within the broader context of information system requirements.

### **ðŸ“— Proposal & Claim Form Design in the Context of Information System Requirements**

An insurer's information system must be designed to meet the needs of its various users, from senior management to the actuarial, underwriting, and claims departments. The system's effectiveness is fundamentally dependent on the quality of the data it contains. Proposal and claim forms are the primary interface for collecting this essential data from the insured and claimant, respectively. Therefore, their design is a crucial component of establishing a good information system.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 1\. The Role of Forms in Data Capture**

Proposal and claim forms are the foundational tools for data capture. A well-designed information system requires that these forms gather information in a way that is unambiguous and formatted for easy and accurate entry into the computer system. Failure at this stage leads to the "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (GIGO) principle, where even sophisticated systems and models produce flawed results due to poor initial data quality.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 2\. Design Principles for Proposal Forms**

The proposal form is the prime information source for policy data. It must be designed to capture all the necessary details to underwrite and price the risk accurately.

* **Clarity and Objectivity:** Questions on the form should be well-designed, clear, and unambiguous. This ensures the proposer provides correct and complete information, which the underwriting department can then process readily. Subjective questions should be avoided in favour of objective ones.  
* **Ease of Data Entry:** The form should be structured to allow for straightforward data entry into the system, including any necessary coding by the underwriting department. This operational consideration is vital for efficiency and accuracy.  
* **Capturing Key Information:** The form must collect all information needed for the policy database, including:  
  * **Rating Variables:** All characteristics used in the rating algorithm to segment risk and calculate the premium.  
  * **Underwriting Variables:** Any additional characteristics used for risk selection and underwriting decisions.  
  * **Policyholder Details:** Name, address, and any other necessary identifiers.  
  * **Optional Covers:** Information on any optional coverages the policyholder has selected, as these will have their own pricing considerations.

#### **ðŸ”¹ 3\. Design Principles for Claim Forms**

Similarly, the claim form is the main source of information for the claims database. Its design is critical for capturing the details needed to process the claim and link it back to the correct policy.

* **Clarity and System Integration:** Like the proposal form, questions must be clear and unambiguous. The design should facilitate easy transfer of information to the computer system, which should then automatically refer to the corresponding policy record to verify coverage.  
* **Linking to the Policy:** The form must capture the necessary identifiers (eg, policy number) to create a clear link between the claim record and the original policy record. This link is fundamental for matching losses with the premiums and risk characteristics that generated them.  
* **Capturing Essential Claim Details:** The form needs to collect all key claim information, including:  
  * **Dates:** Date of loss and date of notification are critical for data aggregation and analysis.  
  * **Cause of Loss:** Details on the peril or cause of loss are required for granular analysis.  
  * **Claimant Details:** Information to identify the claimant(s).

#### **ðŸ”¹ 4\. Broader Context and User Requirements**

The design of these forms cannot happen in isolation. It must be part of a collaborative, user-centric process involving all potential data users (eg, actuarial, underwriting, claims, marketing). This ensures the final system meets all essential business requirements and priorities. Involving all stakeholders helps create a single, integrated data system that is compatible throughout the organisation and avoids the pitfalls of conflicting or incomplete data capture.

In conclusion, proposal and claim forms are not merely administrative documents; they are the bedrock of an insurer's data infrastructure. Their thoughtful designâ€”emphasising clarity, objectivity, and ease of system integrationâ€”is a fundamental requirement for building an information system that can provide the reliable, high-quality data needed for accurate pricing, sound reserving, and effective overall business management.
