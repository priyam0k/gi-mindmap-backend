As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note on the **Common Examples of Exposure Measures**, placing them within the larger context of a product's **Key Product Features**. For your SP8 exam, being able to identify and justify the appropriate exposure measure for any given product—even a novel one—is a fundamental application skill \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

### **The Larger Context: Exposure Measures as a Key Product Feature**

When we analyse any general insurance product, we break it down into six fundamental features \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The **Measure of Exposure** is a core component that forms the base to which premium rates are applied \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

The exposure measure is the unit used to quantify the "amount of risk" a policy represents \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. An ideal measure is proportional to the expected claim amount (frequency and severity), practical to obtain, objective, verifiable, and not easily manipulated \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. In practice, perfect measures are rare, so the chosen measure is often a basic indicator refined by various rating factors \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

Let's examine the common examples of exposure measures for the principal product types, as outlined in the sources.

### **1\. Examples for Liability Insurance**

Liability insurance indemnifies the insured against legal liability to pay compensation to a third party \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. The exposure measures are chosen to be proxies for the scale of this potential liability.

* **Employers’ Liability (EL) / Workers' Compensation**: The main measure of exposure is **payroll** (total wage and salary costs) \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. This is a logical choice because compensation for employee injury is often related to their salary, such as through loss of earnings claims \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. Since the final payroll for a policy year isn't known in advance, it is common to charge an initial premium based on an estimate and then apply an **adjustment premium** at year-end based on the actual payroll \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Public and Product Liability**: **Turnover** is the most commonly used measure of exposure \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. This acts as a proxy for the level of business activity and, therefore, the potential for causing harm to the public or for faulty products entering the market.  
* **Motor Third Party Liability**: The standard measure is the **vehicle-year** \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Professional Indemnity (PI) / Directors' & Officers' (D\&O) Liability**: **Turnover** is again the most common measure \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. However, alternative measures may be more appropriate for specific professions, such as **amount of funds under management** for a fund manager's PI policy, or **net assets and liabilities** for a D\&O policy \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

### **2\. Examples for Property Damage Insurance**

This type of insurance indemnifies the policyholder for loss of or damage to their *own* property \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. Exposure measures are typically related to the value or scale of the property at risk.

* **Household and Commercial Property**: The exposure is frequently measured in **sum insured years** (the sum insured multiplied by the period at risk) \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. For some household products, **number of bedrooms** has been used as a practical proxy for the size and value of the risk \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Motor Own Damage**: The standard measure is the **vehicle-year** \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. The sources note that **vehicle-miles** would likely be a better indicator of risk, as the chance of an accident depends on usage. However, mileage is difficult to verify, so the more practical vehicle-year is used instead \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Marine and Aviation Property**: Measures vary and can include the **insured value of the hull/aircraft** or the **value of the cargo**. For aviation specifically, the **number of take-offs and landings** is also used, as this is when most losses occur \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Goods in Transit**: The **consignment value** is the most common measure \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Construction and Engineering**: Either the **value of the contract** or the **sum insured value** may be used \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Extended Warranty**: A possible measure is **appliance-years** (the number of appliances multiplied by the number of years of cover) \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

### **3\. Examples for Financial Loss Insurance**

This category covers financial losses distinct from direct property damage or liability claims \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

* **Business Interruption (BI)**: The exposure measure is typically the **annual profit or turnover** of the business being insured \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Creditor Insurance / Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)**: The measure depends on the type of credit \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * For personal loans, it is normally the **amount of the loan** or the total amount payable under the policy \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, SP8 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP442, SP3630\].  
  * For a mortgage, it is the **insured monthly benefit** \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * For a credit card, it is the **outstanding balance** \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Mortgage Indemnity**: A possible measure is the **excess of the loan amount over a certain percentage of the property's value** (the "normal advance") \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

### **4\. Examples for Fixed Benefit Insurance**

This type of cover pays a pre-agreed, fixed amount upon a specified event, regardless of the actual financial loss incurred \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

* **Personal Accident**: The true measure of exposure is the **person-year multiplied by the sum insured** \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. For group schemes where benefits are linked to employee salaries, the exposure measure is often the **total sum insured or total salaries** \[SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf\].
