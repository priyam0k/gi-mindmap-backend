As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's establish a foundational note on the **Definition of Reinsurance**. A clear, precise definition is the starting point for any exam answer on this topic, as it demonstrates a solid grasp of the fundamental principles of general insurance.

### **Reinsurance: General Insurance Principles**

#### **ðŸ”¸ Definition**

**Reinsurance** is a form of insurance purchased by an insurance company from another insurance company. In simpler terms, it is the insurance of insurance companies. This transaction involves one party, known as the **cedant** (or direct writer/primary insurer), passing on or "ceding" a portion of its risks to another party, the **reinsurer**. The reinsurer, in turn, may also purchase its own reinsurance to protect itself; this practice is known as **retrocession**.

The core purpose of this arrangement is to allow an insurance company to protect itself against the risk of losses by transferring part of its own risk portfolio. It is a crucial risk management tool for insurers.

##### **Key Terminology in the Definition**

A strong definition incorporates the specific language used in the market. For your SP8 and SA3 exams, you should be comfortable with the following terms:

* **Reinsurance**: A form of insurance purchased by an insurer from a reinsurer to protect against loss. It is often described as the "insurance of insurance companies".  
* **Cedant / Ceding Company**: The insurance company that purchases reinsurance, thereby "ceding" or passing on a portion of its risk portfolio. This party is also referred to as the **direct writer** or **primary insurer**, highlighting its direct contractual relationship with the original policyholder.  
* **Reinsurer**: The company that provides the reinsurance cover to the cedant.  
* **Retrocession**: The process where a reinsurer purchases its own reinsurance to protect its portfolio of assumed reinsurance business. It is effectively the reinsurance of reinsurance.  
  * **Retrocedant**: The ceding reinsurer in a retrocession agreement.  
  * **Retrocessionnaire**: The assuming reinsurer in a retrocession agreement.

*Exam Coach Tip: In any exam question asking you to define or discuss reinsurance, start with a clear and concise definition like the one above. Immediately follow up by defining the key parties involved (cedant, reinsurer) to demonstrate a complete understanding of the transaction's structure. Mentioning retrocession shows breadth of knowledge and is a good way to secure higher-order skill marks, especially when discussing market structure or the chain of risk transfer.*
