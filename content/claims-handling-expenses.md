### **1\. Introduction to Types of Reserves: The Foundational Context**

First and foremost, we must position Claims Handling Expenses (CHE) within the grand scheme of an insurer's financial liabilities. An insurer's balance sheet includes **Technical Reserves** (also known as insurance reserves or insurance provisions), which are the amounts set aside to cover expected future claim payments and their associated expenses.

These technical reserves are broadly categorised into two main groups:

* **Past Liabilities**: These are claims and expenses for events that have *already occurred* prior to the accounting date. This category is where CHE fundamentally resides.  
* **Future Liabilities**: These relate to future insurance cover from policies for which premiums have already been received, such as Unearned Premium Reserves (UPR) and Additional Unexpired Risk Reserves (AURR) .

Within Past Liabilities, the **Outstanding Claims Reserve (OCR)** is the primary component. The OCR itself can be split into up to five distinct elements, one of which is the **Reserve for Claims Handling Expenses**.

### **2\. Claims Handling Expenses: Definition and Components**

The sources define the **Reserve for Claims Handling Expenses (CHE)** as "provision for internal and external claims handling expenses". These are expenses incurred by the company in settling claims across various categories, including outstanding reported, IBNR, IBNER, and re-opened claims.

Claims handling expenses are typically categorised into two types:

* **Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE)**: These are claims handling expenses that can be *directly attributable* to a particular claim. Examples include legal defence costs, payments to claimantsâ€™ solicitors, and fees to loss adjusters. ALAE are often included within the claims data itself and implicitly projected as part of the claims projection.  
* **Unallocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ULAE)**: These are claims handling expenses that are *not directly attributable* to a specific claim but arise from general processes involved in claims handling. An example is the fees paid to a consultancy to review case estimates and IBNR held.

### **3\. Placement and Interplay within the Reserve Structure**

While CHE should always be covered by reserves, they may not always be shown as a standalone item in financial accounts. If an insurer's reserves are only broadly categorised (e.g., into outstanding reported claims and IBNR), then the reserve for CHE might be implicitly included within these larger buckets.

The sources highlight that CHE are applicable across different types of claims delay:

* **Reporting Delays**: These impact IBNR and can also affect IBNER and CHE.  
* **Settlement Delays**: These directly affect outstanding reported claims, IBNER, and CHE.  
* **Premature Closure of Claims Files**: This leads to re-opened claims, which in turn generate further CHE.

### **4\. Nature, Measurement, and Actuarial Considerations**

Understanding and properly accounting for CHE is vital for accurate reserving:

* **Incurrence and Data Recording**: Insurers incur these expenses in settling claims \[113(e), 596(e)\]. Some data systems may record claim payments and claims handling expenses separately, while others may combine them. Actuaries must confirm what is included in the claims data received.  
* **Impact on Claims Data**: Changes in data storage protocols or reliance on third-party claims handlers can lead to inconsistencies and distortions in claims development patterns. This can affect recorded claim frequency, severity, and delays, potentially leading to errors in reserving.  
* **Split between Indemnity and Expenses**: It is "very useful for the insurer to understand how its claim costs break down between indemnity payments (returning policyholders to their prior position) and expenses (costs of investigation, legal defence etc.)". While direct expenses are often included in individual claim records, maintaining separate records offers flexibility, for example, to make separate allowances for inflation. Indirect expenses should generally be treated as administration expenses to avoid distorting claims data.  
* **Inflation Allowance**: CHE are subject to inflation, often linked to salary and price inflation. Actuaries must include an allowance for future cost increases in their expense assumptions, ensuring consistency with other technical provisions.  
* **Projection Methods**:  
  * ALAE are often implicitly projected with claims.  
  * For ULAE, a common approach is to relate historical paid ULAE to paid losses, applying a percentage uplift to total outstanding losses, with adjustments for uneven expense incidence.  
  * CHE can be allowed for either explicitly (as a separate component) or implicitly (e.g., as an additional percentage loading to the claim payment).  
  * The Average Cost Per Claim (ACPC) method needs careful definition of how re-opened claims are treated to avoid distorting settled claims counts and average costs, which implicitly impacts CHE within claim costs.

### **5\. Regulatory and Accounting Treatment**

Claims handling expense provisions are generally allowable for tax purposes, provided they are justified and calculated with sufficient accuracy to be considered specific and thus tax deductible.

Under **Solvency II**, Technical Provisions must account for "all expenses that will be incurred in servicing insurance and reinsurance obligations". The best estimate component of Technical Provisions includes "all future claims payments and claims management expenses (both allocated and unallocated) arising from claims events that have occurred". Future expense cash flows are expressed in their likely currency of occurrence and discounted at appropriate EIOPA rates.

### **6\. Impact on Broader Actuarial Work**

CHE are not isolated to reserving but permeate other actuarial functions:

* **Pricing**: In pricing models, CHE are a direct cost component. For example, a premium formula can explicitly include "claims handling expenses of CE for each claim". Expense analyses are crucial for setting appropriate premium rates, distinguishing between direct (e.g., claims settlement expenses) and indirect expenses (e.g., general management costs). ALAE and ULAE may also be incorporated into pricing tools like Increased Limit Factors (ILFs) and first loss scales.  
* **Capital Modelling**: For capital modelling, "claim management costs" (which include CHE) are part of ultimate gross claims data. Expenses, both acquisition and administrative, are key assumptions needed for capital models. The expenses relating to claims handling can be allowed for explicitly or implicitly in capital models.  
* **Financial Projections**: For investment and Asset-Liability Management (ALM), the liability outgo projections explicitly include "expenses to be paid" in addition to claims and recoveries. This confirms that CHE are a significant ongoing cash outflow requiring careful projection.

In conclusion, dear candidates, Claims Handling Expenses are far more than a mere footnote in an insurer's financial statements. They are an integral, often complex, component of claims liabilities, requiring meticulous data management, appropriate reserving methodologies, and consistent treatment across reserving, pricing, and capital modelling to ensure a true and fair view of an insurer's financial health and solvency. Always be prepared to "split indemnity cost from expenses" and question the underlying data and assumptions related to CHE.
