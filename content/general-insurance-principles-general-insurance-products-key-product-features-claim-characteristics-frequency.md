Based on the sources provided, **Frequency** is a key metric used in general insurance ratemaking to measure the rate at which claims occur. It is a fundamental component of claim characteristics, which also include severity (average cost per claim), reporting delays, and settlement delays. Understanding frequency helps actuaries and insurers analyze trends, price products equitably, and manage risk.

### **Definition and Calculation of Frequency**

Frequency is formally calculated as the number of claims divided by the number of exposures.

**Formula**: Frequency \= (Number of Claims) / (Number of Exposures)

For example, if an insurer has 100,000 reported claims against 2,000,000 earned exposures, the frequency is 5%. The components of this ratio must be clearly defined; typically, the numerator is the number of reported claims and the denominator is the number of earned exposures, but other variations exist.

The sources also note that frequency can be calculated in different ways depending on the context:

* **Reported Claim Frequency**: Uses the number of reported claims.  
* **Incremental Calendar Year Frequency**: Involves splitting calendar year claim counts by accident year and matching them to the appropriate exposures to avoid distortions from a changing portfolio size.  
* **Adjusted Frequency**: In medical malpractice, this can be the number of claims divided by premium, which accounts for both pure frequency trend and premium trend.

### **Role and Analysis of Frequency**

Analyzing frequency is crucial for several reasons in the pricing and financial management of an insurer:

* **Identifying Trends**: Changes in claim frequency can reveal general industry trends related to the incidence of claims or how insurance coverage is being utilized. For instance, a rising frequency could signal an increased propensity to claim within a population.  
* **Measuring Underwriting Effectiveness**: Frequency analysis helps measure the effectiveness of specific underwriting actions. A successful underwriting strategy aimed at selecting lower-risk insureds should result in a lower claim frequency.  
* **Separating Pricing Components**: Actuaries typically analyze frequency and severity separately to better understand the underlying drivers of loss trends. A pure premium analysis might mask offsetting trends; for example, a company marketing higher deductibles might see a lower frequency but a higher severity. This separation is a key feature of the **frequency-severity approach** to pricing.  
* **Input for Models**: Frequency distributions are a key input for stochastic models like the **Collective Risk Model**, which is used for pricing and capital modelling. Distributions like the Poisson or Negative Binomial are often used to model claim frequency.

### **Factors Influencing Claim Frequency**

The sources highlight a wide range of factors that can cause claim frequency to change over time.

**External Factors**:

* **Economic Conditions**: Recessions may lead to an increase in fraudulent claims or claims related to theft and arson. Conversely, an economic downturn could also lead to a different mix of business if certain segments can no longer afford insurance.  
* **Social and Behavioral Trends**: A growing "compensation culture" or an increased propensity to claim, often encouraged by claims management companies or "no-win-no-fee" legal arrangements, can significantly increase claim frequency. Changes in social attitudes, such as increased intolerance for drink-driving, can reduce the frequency of related accidents.  
* **Legal and Regulatory Environment**: Legislative changes can directly impact frequency. For instance, new health and safety regulations might reduce the frequency of workplace accidents, though they could also lead to new types of claims being filed.  
* **Climate Change**: Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, which in turn will drive up the frequency of claims for related perils like floods and storms.

**Internal and Operational Factors**:

* **Underwriting and Product Design**: Changes in underwriting criteria, policy conditions (like deductibles), or the introduction of new products can alter the risk profile of the portfolio and thus the claim frequency.  
* **Distribution Channels**: The channel through which a policy is sold (eg, broker, direct, internet) can attract different types of policyholders, leading to variations in claim frequency. The lack of face-to-face interaction on internet channels, for example, may increase the possibility of fraud.  
* **Claims Handling Procedures**: Changes in how claims are reported or processed, such as introducing an online claims portal, can increase the propensity to claim or change the pattern of nil claims being reported.

**Risk Characteristics (Rating Factors)**:

* **Inherent Risk of the Insured**: For most lines of business, frequency varies significantly based on risk characteristics, which are used as rating variables. Examples include:  
  * **Motor Insurance**: Driver age is a key factor, with younger drivers typically having a higher claim frequency. Vehicle characteristics, driving history, and location also influence frequency.  
  * **Homeowners Insurance**: Prior claims history is a significant predictor; risks with prior claims tend to have a higher future frequency.  
* **Moral Hazard**: The behavior of a policyholder can change after obtaining insurance, potentially increasing claim frequency. This is a key reason for policy exclusions and conditions.

In summary, frequency is a vital statistic in general insurance pricing, reflecting the rate of claim incidence per unit of exposure. It is influenced by a complex interplay of external environmental factors, internal company practices, and the inherent risk characteristics of the insured portfolio. Analyzing it separately from severity provides deeper insights for actuaries to build robust and equitable pricing models.
