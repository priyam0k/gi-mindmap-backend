As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note sequence on the **Key Product Features** that actuaries must understand, placing them in the larger context of **General Insurance Products**. For your SP8 exam, being able to dissect a product—even a novel one—into these fundamental features is a core application skill. These features dictate the risks the insurer faces and are the building blocks for pricing, reserving, and capital management.

The sources break down the analysis of any general insurance product into six key features. Let's explore each in detail, providing exam-oriented context.

### **1\. Benefits Provided**

The benefits are the core of the insurance promise—what the insurer pays out upon a valid claim. The nature of the benefit is a primary determinant of the product's risk profile.

* **Indemnity vs. Fixed Benefit:**

  * **Indemnity:** This is the most common principle, aiming to restore the insured to their financial position immediately before the loss. The benefit amount is directly linked to the financial loss incurred and is therefore variable and subject to inflation. This applies to most property damage and liability products.  
  * **Fixed Benefit:** Here, the policy pays a specified, pre-agreed amount upon a defined event, regardless of the actual financial loss. Personal Accident insurance is the classic example. From an insurer's perspective, this feature significantly reduces risk as the payout is known and not subject to claims inflation.  
* **Settlement Basis (for Indemnity Products):**

  * **Reinstatement/Rebuild Cost:** Common for buildings insurance, this covers the cost to restore the property to its previous condition, excluding the value of the land.  
  * **Replacement Value / "New for Old":** Common for household contents, this covers the cost of an equivalent new item, rather than the depreciated value of the lost item. This is a deviation from pure indemnity.  
  * **Market/Depreciated Value:** Standard for motor own damage, where the maximum payout for a "write-off" is the vehicle's second-hand market value at the time of the accident.  
* **Restrictions on Benefits:** Benefits are almost always restricted by policy terms to control the insurer's exposure:

  * **Excess/Deductible:** A portion of the loss paid by the policyholder. This reduces the number and amount of claims and discourages small claims.  
  * **Limits:** A maximum amount payable per claim, per event, or in aggregate per year.

### **2\. Insured Perils**

A peril is the event or cause that gives rise to a loss (e.g., fire, theft, flood, negligence). The policy document meticulously defines which perils are covered and which are explicitly excluded.

* **Named Perils vs. "All Risks":**

  * **Named Perils:** The policy lists the specific perils that are covered (e.g., fire, lightning, explosion).  
  * **"All Risks":** This basis covers all causes of damage that are not specifically excluded in the policy document. This is common for household policies.  
* **Common Perils by Product Type:**

  * **Liability:** The primary peril is the insured's **negligence** or commission of a tort, leading to legal liability to a third party. Specific perils vary by product, such as faulty product design (Product Liability) or exposure to harmful working conditions (Employers' Liability).  
  * **Property:** Key perils include fire, theft, storm, and flood.  
  * **Financial Loss:** Perils are specific events causing financial hardship, such as unemployment/disability (Creditor Insurance) or employee dishonesty (Fidelity Guarantee).  
  * **Fixed Benefit:** The peril is a specified accident resulting in a defined injury (e.g., loss of a limb).  
* **Exclusions:** Exclusions are critical for defining the scope of cover and managing uninsurable or high-hazard risks. Common exclusions include war, terrorism, illegal acts by the policyholder, and losses under the control of the insured (to reduce moral hazard).

### **3\. Basis for Cover**

This feature determines *when* a policy responds to a claim, which is a crucial distinction, especially for long-tail classes.

* **Losses-Occurring Basis:** The policy provides cover for losses that *occur* during the policy period, regardless of when they are reported. This is the standard for most property and compulsory liability classes (e.g., UK Employers' Liability). The key risk for the insurer is the IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) liability, which can be substantial for latent claims.  
* **Claims-Made Basis:** The policy covers claims that are *reported* to the insurer during the policy period, irrespective of when the loss event occurred. This is the standard for Professional Indemnity, D\&O, and Product Liability. This basis helps the insurer manage the long-tail risk by reducing the pure IBNR exposure, but can create gaps in cover for policyholders.

### **4\. Measures of Exposure**

This is the unit used to measure the "amount of risk" a policy represents, forming the basis for the premium calculation. An ideal exposure measure should be a good proxy for the expected claim amount and be practical (objective, verifiable, and not easily manipulated).

* **Common Measures by Product Type:**  
  * **Liability:** **Turnover** is the most common measure for Public and Product Liability, while **payroll** is standard for Employers' Liability.  
  * **Property:** **Sum insured years** is frequently used for household and commercial property, while the **vehicle-year** is standard for motor insurance.  
  * **Financial Loss:** Varies by product; for example, **annual profit/turnover** for Business Interruption and the **amount of the loan** for Creditor Insurance.  
  * **Fixed Benefit:** For Personal Accident insurance, the measure is the **person-year multiplied by the sum insured**.

### **5\. Claim Characteristics**

This feature describes the nature of claims arising from a product, which directly influences reserving, capital requirements, and investment strategy.

* **Short-tail vs. Long-tail:** This is a critical distinction.

  * **Short-tail** products, like property damage, have claims that are reported and settled quickly. Reserving is less uncertain, but there is significant **accumulation risk** from single catastrophic events.  
  * **Long-tail** products, primarily liability, have significant delays between the claim event and final settlement. This creates high uncertainty in reserving and pricing, sensitivity to inflation, and requires substantial capital backing.  
* **Frequency and Severity:**

  * Claim frequency and the shape of the claim severity distribution vary significantly by product.  
  * Personal lines like motor and household have relatively high frequency.  
  * Liability claims tend to be low frequency but high severity, with widely spread and skewed cost distributions.

### **6\. Risk and Rating Factors**

While the exposure measure provides a base, **rating factors** are used to refine the premium to reflect the specific risk characteristics of an individual policyholder or risk. An underwriter may also use additional subjective **underwriting factors**.

* **Purpose:** To create homogeneous risk groups and charge an equitable premium, thereby reducing the risk of anti-selection.  
* **Desirable Properties:** Good rating factors should clearly define the risk, be practical, objective, verifiable, acceptable to the market, and not easily manipulated.  
* **Examples by Product Type:**  
  * **Motor:** Driver age, vehicle make/model (often via ABI groups), location, and past claims experience (NCD) are key rating factors, acting as proxies for underlying risks like driving ability and mileage.  
  * **Household Property:** Sum insured, location (for theft, flood, subsidence risk), property type and age, and security measures are common factors.  
  * **Employers' Liability:** The primary risk factor is the type of industry or occupation of the employees.

By systematically analysing any general insurance product through these six key features, you can build a robust understanding of the risks it poses to the insurer and the fundamental considerations for its financial management.
