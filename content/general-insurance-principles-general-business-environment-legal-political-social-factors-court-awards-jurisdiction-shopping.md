As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, I confirm that **Jurisdiction Shopping** is a significant manifestation of legal and social risk, directly linked to the determination and volatility of **Court Awards** in liability claims. This practice introduces complex pricing challenges and market risk for international insurers.

## **Jurisdiction Shopping in the Context of Court Awards**

Court awards are essential influences on the general insurance business, particularly in liability classes, as they determine both whether liability exists and the amount of compensation (quantum). Even though most claims are settled through negotiation out of court, judicial decisions establish crucial **benchmarks** that negotiators use.

### **I. Definition and Motivation**

Jurisdiction shopping is a direct result of the differences that exist across various legal systems concerning compensation levels and procedures.

**Definition:** Jurisdiction shopping occurs when a claimant attempts to launch legal proceedings in the jurisdiction that is considered the **most claimant-friendly** in order to maximize any potential financial award.

**Drivers:** The size of compensation awarded for liability claims is influenced by judges or juries, and awards for pain and suffering tend to grow at a faster rate than general inflation. This trend of increasing generosity is amplified when claimants can strategically choose a venue known for favorable awards.

### **II. Examples of Jurisdiction Shopping**

The sources highlight this problem in both international and domestic (US) contexts:

1. **Aviation Insurance (International Context):** Jurisdiction shopping is a particular issue in aviation insurance, often linked to the terms of the Montreal Convention (an international treaty defining airline liabilities for passengers). Changes to this treaty have heightened awareness that countries that have not signed up to the agreement may offer compensation arrangements **more favorable to claimants**, leading people to attempt to claim under those jurisdictions.  
2. **US Asbestos Litigation (Domestic Context):** Within the United States, the law concerning asbestos claims differs between states. Some states are notorious for being **more plaintiff friendly** than others. Consequently, asbestos claimants often attempt to file their claims in these specific beneficial locations to maximize their recovery.

### **III. Insurer Implications and Mitigation**

This tendency introduces significant uncertainty for insurers writing liability business, as the ultimate severity of a claim may be determined by external legal maneuvering rather than solely the facts of the case.

* **Exposure Management:** International insurers, such as those operating in the London Market, face increased complexity because policies may be written in one currency but incur claims across multiple territories and currencies, where different legal environments exist.  
* **Tort Reform as Mitigation:** The ability of claimants to "forum shop" has been partially addressed in the US through the enactment of **tort reform** laws. These laws are designed to constrain the freedom exercised by juries (who often set US tort awards), for example, by placing monetary limits on the compensation payable.
