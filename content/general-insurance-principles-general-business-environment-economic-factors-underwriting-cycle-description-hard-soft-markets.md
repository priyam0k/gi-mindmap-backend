As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, I can provide a detailed discussion on the **Underwriting Cycle**, focusing specifically on the **Description of Hard and Soft Markets**. This cyclical behavior is a paramount economic factor that influences strategy, pricing, and capital management for general insurers.

## **Description of the Underwriting Cycle (Hard and Soft Markets)**

The underwriting cycle, often referred to as the "insurance cycle," is a continuous oscillation in the overall profitability and premium rates within the general insurance industry over a period of years. This phenomenon is driven by changing levels of profitability in the market, which subsequently affects market capacity.

### **1\. Hard Market (High Premiums, High Profitability)**

The hard market represents the peak of the cycle, characterized by high premium rates and high profitability.

* **Pricing and Profit:** Premium rates are high (or "hard") during this phase. The business written is typically **profitable**. Insurers can make a \*\* large allowance for profit\*\* in their premiums.  
* **Capacity and Terms:** During a hard market, capacity/supply is limited. Policy terms and conditions are generally **more stringent**. For example, as the market hardens, terms tend to tighten, with deductibles being added or policies attaching at a higher level.  
* **Market Response:** Companies typically respond to this profitability by trying to **expand their market share**. To do this, some companies may become aggressive in pricing, which puts pressure on others to respond by reducing prices, initiating the soft market. New capital is attracted to the market, and existing insurers are encouraged to write more business.  
* **Policyholder Experience:** It is difficult for policyholders to buy insurance cheaply during a hard market. Individuals who perceive themselves as low-risk may choose to self-insure rather than pay the high premiums, resulting in **anti-selection** against the insurer.

### **2\. Soft Market (Low Premiums, Low Profitability)**

The soft market represents the trough of the cycle, characterized by low premium rates, intense competition, and reduced profitability.

* **Pricing and Profit:** Premium rates are low (or "soft") and business written is generally **less profitable**. The business may even become loss-making. Insurers often need to make a much smaller allowance for profit (if any) in their premiums.  
* **Capacity and Terms:** During the soft phase, there is lots of capacity/supply. Policy terms and conditions are often **less stringent**. Deductibles may be reduced or removed, and coverage expands.  
* **Market Response:** Competition drives down premiums. Insurers may tolerate lower premiums to **maintain market share**. However, those struggling due to low profits may become insolvent and **leave the market** or reduce the amount of business they write. This restricted availability of insurance eventually causes rates to increase, hardening the market.  
* **Claim Development:** Recent studies suggest the existence of a 'reserving cycle' highly correlated with the underwriting cycle. In a soft market, incurred claims development patterns are observed to be **slower to develop** (or longer-tailed) than in a hard market. This tendency to defer claim payments may be due to insurers trying to reduce the rate of claim payout when cashflows are tight.

### **III. Transition and Duration of the Cycle**

The progression between hard and soft markets is continuous, although the transition from soft back to hard is often abrupt.

* **Trigger Events:** Soft markets often end when a **major disaster** (catastrophe) triggers severe losses at a time when premium levels cannot support the normal claim level. Examples cited include Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and the terrorist attacks of September 2001\.  
* **Cycle Duration and Variability:** Although a clear cyclical pattern has been observed historically, it is **difficult to predict going forwards**. The frequency and amplitude of the cycle can change every time the market turns. The length of the underwriting cycle varies by class of business and territory (e.g., around seven years for some UK personal lines classes).  
* **Market Awareness:** It is crucial for the actuary to understand the existence and current stage of the underwriting cycle to effectively respond to changes in market conditions. Pricing decisions may intentionally deviate from the actuarially indicated technical price due to market competitive pressures inherent in the cycle.
