As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, I can discuss **Subsidence and Heave** as specific manifestations of weather impact within the broader context of **Climate and Environmental Factors**. These perils are critical considerations for property insurers, particularly because they exhibit specific seasonal patterns and often fall outside the scope of traditional catastrophe modeling and reinsurance.

## **I. Definition and Physical Mechanism**

Subsidence and heave are linked phenomena involving the movement of land upon which buildings are constructed, leading to structural damage claims, particularly for domestic property.

1. **Subsidence:** This involves a **downward movement of land** due to a reduction in hydration (drying up). The shrinkage of the ground causes damage to the houses built upon it.  
2. **Heave:** This is essentially the **opposite of subsidence**, involving an **upward movement** of land due to increased soil hydration. Heave can occur, for example, after trees are felled in an area because they no longer absorb moisture from the soil.

## **II. Seasonal and Weather Influence**

The incidence of subsidence and heave is strongly correlated with specific weather conditions, making them a key aspect of climate risk, distinct from immediate storm damage.

1. **Seasonal Occurrence:** Although weather is generally more benign in summer than in winter, the problems of subsidence and heave are **generally more likely to arise in the summer**.  
2. **Driving Conditions:** This is particularly true **when it is very dry and hot**.  
3. **Exacerbation:** The structural damage caused by the shrinkage of the land is often **exacerbated when the drought breaks and the ground expands again**.  
4. **Claim Profile:** These phenomena can lead to a **large number of claims** for structural damage, especially in domestic property, and many of these claims **can be large** in cost.

## **III. Actuarial and Reinsurance Implications**

The nature of subsidence claims creates unique challenges for risk transfer and data management that differ from acute catastrophe events.

1. **Claim Development:** Subsidence claims are an exception to the general rule that property claims are reported and settled quickly. They **can take years to recognize, stabilize, and settle** the cost of repair.  
2. **Catastrophe Reinsurance Limitation:** Since the damage is often **not caused over a short period of time** (as it might be with a storm), **catastrophe Excess of Loss (XL) reinsurance may not respond** to these losses.  
3. **Hours Clause:** Catastrophe XL reinsurance covers events that occur within a **limited period**, defined by the **hours clause** (e.g., 24 or 72 hours). Many subsidence claims are deemed to occur outside of this limited period and would thus not be aggregated for the purpose of a reinsurance recovery claim.  
4. **Data Allocation:** Due to the gradual nature of the damage, where a precise date of event cannot be determined, insurers require **very clear rules and procedures** for the allocation of such cases to a claim year.  
5. **Accumulation Risk:** Subsidence is explicitly listed as a peril that can expose a household insurance portfolio to accumulations of claims, similar to fire or explosions, but linked to weather conditions. Aggregate Excess of Loss reinsurance may be purchased to reduce the cost of aggregations of claims resulting from a concentration of household policies in a region prone to subsidence due to soil type.
