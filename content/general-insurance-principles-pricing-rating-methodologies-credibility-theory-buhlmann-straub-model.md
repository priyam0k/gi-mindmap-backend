### **ðŸ“— Chapter 12: Credibility**

#### **ðŸ”¹ Introduction to Credibility Theory**

Credibility theory is an essential ratemaking technique that addresses how to blend an actuarial estimate based on observed experience with one or more sets of related experience to improve the estimate of expected values. The fundamental challenge arises because while the Law of Large Numbers suggests that observed experience will approach "true" experience with sufficient volume, the data available for overall ratemaking or classification ratemaking may not always be sufficient to produce accurate and stable rates.

The core idea is to combine the highly **relevant** but potentially **unreliable** data from a specific risk or group (due to limited volume) with broader, more **reliable** (due to larger volume) but potentially less **relevant** data from a larger group or the market. For instance, an insurer might use an individual insured's past loss information to estimate future coverage costs, but this small dataset might be unstable. Conversely, market-wide data is more statistically reliable due to its volume but might not perfectly reflect the specific business. Credibility theory provides a structured approach to weight these two extreme viewpoints.

The basic formula for calculating a credibility-weighted estimate is: **Estimate \= Z Ã— Observation \+ (1 \- Z) Ã— Other information** Here, 'Z' is the credibility assigned to the observation, and '(1 \- Z)' is the complement of credibility. A higher 'Z' value means more weight is given to the observed data, which is appropriate when the data is large and stable. Conversely, a lower 'Z' is used for limited data, giving more weight to other, related information. This allows actuaries to update an initial "prior hypothesis" about a rate with emerging experience.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Methods for Measuring Credibility in an Actuarial Estimate**

The first step in utilizing credibility is to determine the reliability of the actuarial estimate based on observed experience. Actuarial Standard of Practice (ASOP) Number 25 defines credibility as "a measure of the predictive value in a given application that the actuary attaches to a particular body of data". Two commonly discussed methods for determining credibility are Classical Credibility and BÃ¼hlmann Credibility, both involving explicit calculation of 'Z'. Bayesian analysis is a third method that introduces related experience probabilistically without explicitly calculating 'Z'.

##### **ðŸ”¸ Classical Credibility Approach**

The Classical Credibility approach, also known as limited fluctuation credibility, is widely used in insurance ratemaking. Its goal is to limit the effect of random fluctuations on the risk estimate.

**Full Credibility Criterion:** This approach seeks to determine how much data is needed to statistically assign 100% credibility (Z=1.00) to the observed experience. If the observed data volume is equal to or greater than this standard, Z is 1.00; otherwise, Z is between 0 and 1\.

For example, if an actuary regards loss experience as fully credible when there's a 90% probability that the observed experience is within 5% of its expected value, the expected number of claims needed for full credibility (assuming homogeneous risks, Poisson frequency, and no variation in claim costs) is 1,082. This is derived using a normal approximation, where: $N\_n \= (y/k)^2$, where y is from the Standard Normal table for a given probability P, and k is the deviation percentage.

**Partial Credibility (Square Root Rule):** If the number of observed claims is less than the standard for full credibility, the square root rule is applied to calculate Z: $Z \= \\sqrt{n / N\_n}$ where 'n' is the observed number of claims and '$N\_n$' is the standard for full credibility. This rule ensures that Z increases with the size of the risk but at a decreasing rate, and Z is capped at 1.00.

**Advantages:**

* Most commonly used and generally accepted.  
* Data required is readily available.  
* Computations are straightforward.  
* Simpler to explain to non-actuaries.

**Disadvantages:**

* Derivation involves simplifying assumptions (e.g., no variation in loss size) that may not hold in practice.  
* It uses a selected complement but doesn't explicitly account for the quality of the estimator compared to the latest observation, requiring judgment.  
* Can produce a zero ultimate value if no claims incurred to date, unlike Bornhuetter-Ferguson.  
* The classical method carries forward strong distribution-based assumptions that imply data with a certain 'n' can never have full credibility simply due to random variation.  
* Modelling issues in the external data used as a complement are not specified, leading to plausible errors, especially if internal and external data approaches are based on different assumptions.

##### **ðŸ”¸ BÃ¼hlmann Credibility (Least Squares Credibility)**

BÃ¼hlmann credibility, often called least squares credibility, aims to minimize the square of the error between the estimate and the true expected value of the quantity being estimated.

**Formula for Z:** The credibility-weighted estimate uses a "prior mean" instead of "related experience". Z is defined as: $Z \= N / (N \+ K)$ where N is the number of observations.

**The K Parameter:** K is the ratio of the Expected Value of the Process Variance (EVPV) to the Variance of the Hypothetical Means (VHM). More simply, K is the ratio of the average risk variance to the variance between risks. In practice, K can be difficult to calculate, as EVPV and VHM can be derived from a model (subject to model error) or estimated from data (subject to random fluctuation).

**Behavior of Z:** Unlike classical credibility, BÃ¼hlmann credibility's Z approaches 1.0 asymptotically as N gets larger. This means it never truly reaches 1.0, but gets increasingly close. This contrasts with classical credibility, which equals 1.0 once the full credibility standard is met.

**Assumptions:**

* (1-Z) is applied to the prior mean.  
* Risk parameters and the risk process do not shift over time.  
* The expected value of the process variance (EVPV) of the sum of N observations increases with N.  
* The variance of the hypothetical means (VHM) of the sum of N observations increases with N.

**Comparison to Classical Credibility:**

* For certain parameter values, BÃ¼hlmann and Classical credibility can produce similar results.  
* If simplifying assumptions made in classical credibility (e.g., homogeneous risks, no loss size variation) are applied to BÃ¼hlmann, VHM becomes 0, resulting in Z=0, meaning no credibility is assigned to observed experience.  
* Bayesian credibility often forms the basis of experience rating plans due to its accuracy when estimates of EVPV and VHM are available. Classical credibility is used when these estimates are unknown or difficult to calculate, often in overall rate increases.

**Advantages:**

* Used and generally accepted in the insurance industry.  
* Can generate more accurate rates when its underlying assumptions are met.

**Disadvantages:**

* Major challenge lies in determining EVPV and VHM.  
* Relies on a set of simplifying assumptions that need evaluation for suitability.

##### **ðŸ”¸ Bayesian Analysis**

The third class of credibility analysis is based on Bayesian theory. It differs from BÃ¼hlmann and Classical in that there is no explicit calculation of the Z parameter. Instead, it adjusts a prior estimate to reflect new information in a probabilistic manner, using Bayes' Theorem. This makes it more complex and less commonly used in practice than BÃ¼hlmann credibility. Interestingly, BÃ¼hlmann (least squares) credibility is the weighted least squares line associated with the Bayesian estimate, and in some mathematical situations, the Bayesian analysis estimate is equivalent to the least squares credibility estimate.

#### **ðŸ”¹ The BÃ¼hlmann-Straub Credibility Model**

The BÃ¼hlmann-Straub model is an important and widely used credibility model in insurance practice, developed in 1970 for determining claims ratios in reinsurance. It has found various applications in both life and non-life insurance, and in primary and reinsurance sectors.

**Motivation:** The model addresses the problem of estimating the "true" pure risk premium for a future period, considering both individual claim observations and benchmarks against similar risks. The core question is how much relevance (credibility) to assign to each source of information.

**Key Assumptions:**

* There exists a **latent parameter** ($\\theta\_i$) for each risk 'i' (e.g., a risk profile), which is a random variable and characterizes the underlying long-run claims ratio of risk 'i' ($E\[X\_{ik}|\\theta\_i\] \= \\mu(\\theta\_i)$).  
* The **variance of the observed claims ratio** ($Var\[X\_{ik}|\\theta\_i\]$) for risk 'i' is inversely proportional to the volume measure of risk 'i' ($V\_i$) ($Var\[X\_{ik}|\\theta\_i\] \= \\sigma^2(\\theta\_i) / V\_i$).  
* The 'i-th' risk is described by the sequence of claims ratios observed for risk 'i' in years 'k' ($X\_{ik}$).

**Key Definitions for Parameters:**

* **$\\phi$ (Expected Value of Process Variance, EVPV):** Represents the expected variance of the observed claims ratios per unit of volume ($E\[\\sigma^2(\\theta\_i)\]$ or $E\[Var(X\_{ik} \\cdot V\_i)\]$). It is the average variability of observed claims ratios, accounting for the average volume of data in each cell.  
* **$\\lambda$ (Variance of Hypothetical Means, VHM):** Represents the variance of the long-run claims ratios across all risks ($Var\[\\mu(\\theta\_i)\]$).

**BÃ¼hlmann-Straub Formula for Credibility Factor ($z\_i$):** The credibility factor $z\_i$ for risk 'i' is given by: $z\_i \= V\_i / (V\_i \+ \\phi/\\lambda)$

**BÃ¼hlmann-Straub Credibility Premium ($C^{BE}\_i$):** The best linear estimator for $\\mu(\\theta\_i)$ (the underlying long-run claims ratio of risk 'i') is the credibility estimator: $C^{BE}\_i \= z\_i X\_i \+ (1 \- z\_i) \\beta$ where $X\_i$ is the observed (experience) claims ratio for risk 'i', and $\\beta$ is the benchmark claims ratio (the overall mean of the portfolio, $E\[\\mu(\\theta\_i)\]$).

**Interpretation of the Credibility Factor ($z\_i$):** The weight given to the observed experience ($X\_i$) for risk 'i' increases when:

* $V\_i$ (volume or exposure for risk 'i') increases: More data for the specific risk leads to higher credibility.  
* $\\phi$ (average variability of observed claims ratios) decreases: Less inherent variability makes the observed data more reliable.  
* $\\lambda$ (variance of long-run claims ratios across risks) increases: Wider variation among risks in the benchmark portfolio means the specific risk's own experience is more distinctive and thus more credible.

**Relationship to Bayesian Credibility:** The BÃ¼hlmann-Straub approach shares strong similarities with Bayesian credibility. In fact, with certain distributions and parameters, these two methods yield identical results.

**Application to Pure Premium:** The BÃ¼hlmann-Straub formula estimates the claims ratio for the coming year. To estimate the aggregate claim amount (pure premium), this claims ratio is multiplied by the projected risk volume for the coming year. For example, in motor insurance, the volume measure could be vehicle-years.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Practical Uses and Data Considerations for Credibility Models**

Credibility models are used in experience rating and generally when data is sparse and lacks statistical credibility. They are particularly valuable when historical losses show significant random variation around the underlying expected losses.

**Key Problems Addressed by Credibility:** Two primary problems emerge when applying credibility theory:

1. **How to obtain more data or more reliable data:** This can be achieved by using more years of data, data from broader geographical areas (e.g., countrywide), or by giving more weight to stable phenomena (e.g., focusing on claim counts/frequency rather than highly volatile claim amounts). Partial pure premiums (e.g., property damage liability being more stable than bodily injury liability) can also be used.  
2. **What is the most appropriate credibility complement?** The complement of credibility is crucial, especially when the observed data has low credibility. If the observed experience is highly volatile, the majority of the rate will be driven by the complement of credibility.

**Desirable Qualities for a Complement of Credibility:** A good complement of credibility should possess the following qualities:

1. **Accurate:** It should help rates achieve the lowest possible error variance around future expected losses.  
2. **Unbiased:** It should not be consistently higher or lower than the observed experience, meaning differences between the complement and observed experience should average to zero over time.  
3. **Statistically independent from the base statistic:** Independence is particularly important for intermediate credibility levels (Z between 10% and 90%) to maximize the accuracy of the credibility-weighted estimate. Negative correlation between errors of the two statistics would be ideal but is rare.  
4. **Available:** It should be readily accessible without excessive programming or processing costs.  
5. **Easy to compute:** Simplicity in calculation is a practical consideration.  
6. **Logical relationship to base statistic:** There should be an explainable relationship to support its use.  
7. **Ease of explanation:** It should be easy to communicate to managers and customers.  
8. **Sources of error:** Consideration of where errors in the complement might arise.

**Examples of Complements (First Dollar Ratemaking):**

* Loss costs of a larger group that includes the group being rated.  
* Loss costs of a larger related group.  
* Rate change from the larger group applied to present rates.  
* Harwayne's method (adjusting related experience for distributional differences, e.g., countrywide data adjusted for state-specific differences).  
* Trended present rates.  
* Competitors' rates (useful for new or small companies with unreliable data).

**Judgment in Credibility:** The application of credibility theory is never purely mechanical or formulaic. Actuarial judgment is crucial for various practical features of risk experience, including:

* **Large Claims:** Determining how much to charge an individual risk for a single large, unusual claim from the recent past. This involves defining "large," "unusual," and "recent".  
* **Divergence of Book Rate and Observed Experience:** Deciding what to do when the credibility indication significantly differs from normal underwriting expectations. This may present business opportunities or considerable risks if key features are overlooked.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Credibility When Using Statistical Methods (e.g., GLMs)**

When performing a multivariate classification analysis using statistical techniques such as Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), traditional credibility weighting (as discussed in the formulas above) is typically *not* applied to the model results.

Instead, the meaningfulness of GLM results is assessed using **statistical diagnostics** provided with the model, which inform the modeler about the certainty of the results and the appropriateness of the model assumptions. Examples include:

* **Standard Errors of Parameter Estimates:** Indicate the certainty of parameter estimates. Wide standard errors (often straddling unity) may suggest a factor is detecting mostly noise and should be eliminated.  
* **Deviance Tests (e.g., Chi-Square or F-test):** Used to assess the significance of variables and the appropriateness of the link function and error term selected.  
* **Consistency of Model Results Over Time:** A practical test comparing GLM results for individual years to gauge their consistency.  
* **Model Validation Techniques:** Comparing the expected outcome of the model with historical results on a hold-out sample of data (i.e., data not used in model development) to test effectiveness. This includes segmented validation plots, where actual and modeled results are compared across groups ordered by expected value.  
* **Lift Curves:** Used to assess the predictiveness of a model on out-of-sample data, comparing two models to see which is more effective at distinguishing between good and bad risks.

Some research has explored incorporating Bayesian analysis into statistical modeling (e.g., through hierarchical models), but this is generally considered beyond the scope of the immediate material. Instead of directly applying classical or BÃ¼hlmann credibility formulas, the diagnostics of the statistical models themselves provide the means to gauge the reliability and predictive value of the derived rates.
