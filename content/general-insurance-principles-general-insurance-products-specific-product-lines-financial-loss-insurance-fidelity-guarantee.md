As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note on **Fidelity Guarantee Insurance**, positioning it within the broader framework of **Financial Loss Insurance**. This is a key commercial product that protects businesses from internal threats, and understanding its characteristics is a valuable part of the SP8 syllabus.

### **Specific Product Lines: Financial Loss Insurance**

#### **ðŸ”¸ Fidelity Guarantee Insurance**

Fidelity Guarantee insurance is a specialised type of financial loss cover designed to protect an insured business against financial losses caused by the dishonest actions of its own employees. Such actions typically include fraud or embezzlement. It is one of several products that fall under the general category of financial loss insurance, alongside others such as credit insurance, business interruption, and mortgage indemnity.

##### **1\. Customer Need and Benefits Provided**

The primary customer need met by this product is protection for an employer against financial losses arising from employee dishonesty. While a business might have robust internal controls, the risk of fraud or embezzlement by a trusted employee remains.

The benefits provided under a Fidelity Guarantee policy are designed to indemnify the insured business. This cover includes:

* **Loss of money or goods:** The policy covers the value of money or goods owned by the insured (or for which the insured is responsible) that have been lost due to employee dishonesty.  
* **Investigation Costs:** Policies typically cover the reasonable fees incurred in establishing the size of the loss, such as payments to auditors or accountants.

This type of insurance is often included as a component within a comprehensive "package policy" designed for businesses, particularly small retailers, to cover a range of necessary protections.

##### **2\. Insured Perils**

The central peril covered by a Fidelity Guarantee policy is a **breach of fidelity guarantees** by an employee. The sources define the key insured perils as:

* **Fraud:** This involves wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain for the employee at the expense of the employer.  
* **Embezzlement:** This is defined as the theft or misappropriation of money or other assets that have been placed in an employee's trust or under their control.

##### **3\. Claim Characteristics**

Fidelity Guarantee claims have distinct characteristics that are important for an actuary to understand for reserving and pricing purposes.

* **Reporting Delays:** A key feature of this class is the potential for significant reporting delays. Dishonest actions like fraud or embezzlement may take a considerable amount of time to be discovered by the employer.  
* **Settlement Delays:** Once a claim is reported, settlement can also be delayed. Establishing the full extent of the financial loss can be a complex process, often requiring the involvement of auditors or accountants to conduct a thorough investigation.  
* **Underwriting Basis:** As a commercial policy, Fidelity Guarantee insurance is individually underwritten based on the specific risks presented by the insured business.

*Exam Coach Tip: In an exam, Fidelity Guarantee is a good example to use when discussing commercial package policies or the unique challenges of financial loss lines. You should highlight the potential for long reporting and settlement delays, which makes it a longer-tailed product than some other financial loss lines. Stressing the role of auditors in quantifying the loss demonstrates a practical understanding of the claims process. When discussing underwriting, note that unlike personal lines, this is not a statistically rated product but one that requires individual, judgemental assessment of the insured's internal controls and business environment.*
