As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on **Increasing Underwriting Capacity**, a primary strategic reason for purchasing reinsurance. This concept is fundamental to both SP7 (Reserving and Capital) and SP8 (Pricing), as it directly links risk transfer with an insurer's ability to grow its business and compete effectively in the market \[SP7.pdf\].

### **Reinsurance: General Insurance Principles**

##### **ðŸ”¹ Increasing Underwriting Capacity**

One of the most important strategic reasons for an insurer (the cedant) to purchase reinsurance is to increase its underwriting capacity \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. An insurer's ability to write new business is limited by the capital it holds \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. Reinsurance is a key risk and capital management tool that allows an insurer to expand the volume and size of risks it can underwrite beyond what its own financial strength would otherwise permit \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].

###### **1\. The Mechanism: How Reinsurance Increases Capacity**

The fundamental mechanism by which reinsurance increases capacity is by reducing the net risk retained by the insurer, which in turn reduces the regulatory capital required to support that risk \[Reinsurance.pdf\].

* **Capital Constraint:** An insurer may be reluctant or incapable of accepting particular risks, either by sector or by volume, due to insufficient capital backing \[SP7.pdf\]. Writing new business requires capital to be set aside to cover the associated risks \[SP7.pdf\]. A very large individual risk (such as a major industrial property) or a large volume of new business may require more capital than the insurer has available, forcing it to decline the business \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
* **Reinsurance Solution:** By ceding a portion of its risk portfolio to a reinsurer, the insurer reduces its net liabilities and, consequently, the regulatory capital it is required to hold \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. This freed-up capital can then be used to support new underwriting activities \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. This allows the insurer to:  
  * Accept larger individual risks than its own financial strength would otherwise allow \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
  * Write a greater volume of business overall \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
  * Compete more effectively in the market \[Reinsurance.pdf\].

###### **2\. Application to Different Types of Insurers**

The need to increase capacity is particularly relevant for certain types of insurers:

* **Small or Newer Insurers:** These companies typically have a smaller capital base and a less diversified portfolio, which constrains their ability to accept large or numerous risks. Reinsurance provides the necessary support to grow their business \[Reinsurance.pdf\].  
* **Insurers Facing Capital Strain:** An insurer with a solvency ratio that is reducing, perhaps due to business expansion rather than losses, can use reinsurance to manage its capital position and continue its growth trajectory \[SA3\_Combined\_Notes.pdf\].

###### **3\. Appropriate Reinsurance Products for Increasing Capacity**

While most forms of reinsurance contribute to increasing capacity, some are particularly well-suited for this purpose.

* **Proportional Reinsurance (Quota Share and Surplus):** These are highly effective tools for increasing capacity.  
  * **Quota Share Reinsurance:** By ceding a fixed percentage of every risk, the insurer directly reduces its net written premiums and net liabilities, which are often key metrics in regulatory capital calculations. This directly frees up capital for growth \[Reinsurance.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
  * **Surplus Reinsurance:** This type is especially suitable for enabling an insurer to write larger individual risks. The insurer sets a retention (or "line") and cedes the surplus amount of any risk exceeding that line. This allows the insurer to participate in large risks while controlling its net exposure \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].

*Exam Coach Tip: Questions on the purpose of reinsurance are very common. When discussing "Increasing Capacity," clearly explain the link between writing business, risk retention, and capital requirements. A strong answer will state that reinsurance reduces net risk, which frees up capital, allowing the insurer to write more business or larger risks. For higher-order marks, you should connect this reason to specific reinsurance products, noting that **proportional reinsurance** (especially Quota Share and Surplus) is a primary tool for achieving this objective.*
