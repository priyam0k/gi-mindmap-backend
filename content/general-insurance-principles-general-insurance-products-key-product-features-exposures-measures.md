As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note on **Measures of Exposure**, placing this critical topic within the larger context of the **Key Product Features** that define general insurance products \[SP7.pdf\]. For your SP8 exam, understanding what constitutes a good exposure measure and knowing the common measures used for principal products is fundamental to pricing \[SP8.pdf\]. It forms the base to which premium rates are applied \[SP8.pdf\].

### **The Larger Context: The Six Key Product Features**

When analysing any general insurance product, we break it down into six fundamental features to understand the risks involved \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The Measure of Exposure is one of these six core components:

1. Benefits Provided \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]  
2. Insured Perils \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]  
3. Basis for Cover \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]  
4. **Measures of Exposure** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]  
5. Claim Characteristics \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]  
6. Risk and Rating Factors \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]

The Measure of Exposure is the unit used to quantify the "amount of risk" a policy represents, forming the foundation of the premium calculation \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **1\. The Core Principle and Purpose of an Exposure Measure**

*For the purpose of setting premiums, insurance companies try to determine measures which give an indication of how much risk there is within each policy. These measures are called measures of exposure* \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

The primary objective of an insurer when setting premium rates is to charge a premium that accurately reflects the amount of risk \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The pure risk premium is calculated to cover the expected claim amount, and this calculation relies on an appropriate measure of exposure to determine the premium *rate* \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

In essence, an exposure measure provides a base unit for the premium calculation. Once this is established, **rating factors** are then used to refine the premium for individual risk characteristics \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **2\. Desirable Properties of an Exposure Measure**

The sources outline several criteria that an ideal measure of exposure should satisfy. These are crucial for ensuring the premium is both equitable and practical to calculate \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Good Measure of the Amount of Risk:** The total expected claim amount should be proportional to the exposure \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This means the measure should be a good proxy for both the expected frequency and severity of claims \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Practicality:** This is a broad criterion that encompasses several aspects \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]:  
  * **Objectively Measurable:** The measure should be quantifiable in a consistent way, avoiding subjectivity \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
  * **Easily Obtainable and Verifiable:** The information should be simple to collect from the policyholder and, where necessary, straightforward for the insurer to check \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
  * **Not Open to Manipulation:** The measure should be difficult for the policyholder to misstate in order to obtain a cheaper premium \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

The sources note that perfect measures of exposure rarely exist. In most classes, the chosen measure is a basic principal indicator of risk, which is then refined by various rating factors \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **3\. Common Exposure Measures by Product Type**

The sources provide a comprehensive list of exposure measures used for the principal types of general insurance products.

#### **3.1 Liability Insurance**

* **Employersâ€™ Liability (EL) / Workers' Compensation:** The main measure of exposure is **payroll** (or total wage and salary costs) \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This is because compensation for injury is often related to the employee's salary (e.g., loss of earnings) \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. Since payroll for the upcoming year is not known precisely in advance, an adjustment premium is common at the end of the year \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Public and Product Liability:** The most commonly used measure of exposure is **turnover** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Motor Third Party Liability:** The standard measure is the **vehicle-year** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Professional Indemnity / Directors' & Officers' Liability:** **Turnover** is the most common measure, although alternatives like net assets and liabilities (for D\&O) or amount of funds under management (for a fund manager's PI) may be used \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

#### **3.2 Property Damage Insurance**

* **Household and Commercial Property:** The exposure is frequently measured in **sum insured years** (the sum insured multiplied by the period at risk) \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. Some insurers have used **number of bedrooms** as a proxy for the size of the risk \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Motor Own Damage:** The standard measure is the **vehicle-year** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. While vehicle-miles would probably be a better indicator of risk, it is difficult to verify, so the more practical vehicle-year is used instead \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Marine and Aviation Property:** Measures can include the **insured value of the hull/aircraft**, the **value of the cargo**, or for aviation, the **number of take-offs and landings** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Goods in Transit:** The **consignment value** is most commonly used \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Construction and Engineering:** The **value of the contract** or **sum insured value** may be used \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Extended Warranty:** **Appliance-years** (number of appliances multiplied by the number of years) is a possible measure \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

#### **3.3 Financial Loss Insurance**

* **Business Interruption (BI):** The exposure measure is typically the **annual profit or turnover** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Creditor Insurance / PPI:** For personal loans, it is normally the **amount of the loan** or the total amount payable \[SP7.pdf, SP442, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP3630\]. For a mortgage, it is the **insured monthly benefit**, and for a credit card, it is the **outstanding balance** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Mortgage Indemnity:** A possible measure is the **excess of the loan amount over a certain percentage of the property's value** (the "normal advance") \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

#### **3.4 Fixed Benefit Insurance**

* **Personal Accident:** The true measure of exposure is the **person-year multiplied by the sum insured** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. For group schemes where benefits are linked to salaries, the exposure measure is often the **total sum insured or total salaries** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].
