As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note sequence on the **Common Examples of Exclusions**, placing them within the larger context of **Key Product Features** in general insurance. For your SP8, SP7, and SA3 exams, understanding specific, practical examples of exclusions is crucial for demonstrating your ability to apply core principles to real-world scenarios.

### **The Larger Context: Exclusions as a Key Product Feature**

The **Policy Document** is the legally binding contract that defines the scope of cover for any general insurance product \[SP7.pdf\]. A fundamental feature defined within this document is the list of **Insured Perils**â€”the events that may give rise to a loss \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. Exclusions are the flip side of this; they are explicit clauses that limit the circumstances under which a claim can be made, thereby defining the boundaries of the insurance promise \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. They are a primary tool used by insurers to manage the risk being transferred \[SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

The sources provide numerous common examples of exclusions across a range of products. These examples can be grouped according to the underlying purpose of the exclusion.

### **1\. Examples of Exclusions to Avoid Uninsurable or Catastrophic Risks**

Insurers use exclusions to remove cover for risks that do not meet the core principles of insurability, often because they are not fortuitous or are too widespread and correlated to be managed within a standard portfolio \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **War, Terrorism, Civil Riot:** These are common exclusions across most policies, including Private Motor, Liability, and Personal Accident insurance \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The potential for massive, correlated losses makes these risks commercially uninsurable through standard products \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. In some territories, like the UK, government-backed arrangements exist to cover terrorism, so standard contracts specifically exclude it \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Nuclear or Radioactive Risks:** Similar to war, the potential scale of loss is too vast and unquantifiable for standard policies to cover \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Earthquakes:** This peril is often excluded from standard policies, particularly in regions not prone to seismic activity \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. In earthquake-prone areas, it might be offered as an optional, separately priced extension.

### **2\. Examples of Exclusions to Reduce Moral Hazard**

These exclusions are critical for mitigating the risk that an insured party behaves carelessly or dishonestly simply because they have insurance. They incentivise policyholders to continue taking reasonable precautions \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Illegal Acts by the Policyholder:** Policies consistently exclude losses arising from illegal activities.  
  * **Private Motor:** A claim will be excluded if the driver was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or was driving without a valid licence \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
  * **Liability:** Deliberate fraud by directors is typically excluded from a Directors' & Officers' (D\&O) policy \[SP752.pdf\].  
* **Lack of Due Care:**  
  * **Private Motor:** Theft of a vehicle is often excluded if the keys were left in the ignition \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This directly counters carelessness.  
* **Self-inflicted Injury:**  
  * **Personal Accident:** Suicide and injuries resulting from alcohol or drug abuse are common exclusions \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **3\. Examples of Exclusions to Define the Scope of Cover and Avoid Duplication**

Exclusions are used to clearly define what a product is intended to cover, making it appropriate for a specific market and preventing overlaps with other policies \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Specified Uses:** Policies often exclude uses that fall outside the intended scope of the product.  
  * **Private Motor:** A standard policy will exclude use for business (unless specified) or for racing \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Risks Covered by Other Specialist Policies:**  
  * **Contractors' All Risks (CAR):** A CAR policy may exclude liability to employees, as this is expected to be covered by a separate Employers' Liability policy \[SP752.pdf\].  
* **Pre-existing Conditions:**  
  * **Personal Accident:** Pre-existing conditions such as pregnancy may be excluded \[SP752.pdf\].

### **4\. Examples of Exclusions for Normal Wear & Tear or Events under the Insured's Control**

General insurance is designed to cover sudden and unforeseen losses, not the natural depreciation of an item over time or losses that the insured can control \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Normal Wear and Tear:**  
  * **Private Motor:** Policies will exclude depreciation and damage to tyres from normal use \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
  * **Buildings:** Claims for defective roofs that are found to be due to natural wear and tear rather than a specific insured peril (like a storm) will be excluded \[SP752.pdf\].  
* **High-Risk, Controllable Activities:**  
  * **Personal Accident:** Dangerous pastimes or hazardous hobbies are often excluded unless specifically declared and rated for \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

By studying these common examples, you can better understand the practical application of exclusions and their importance in shaping an insurer's risk profile, which is a key skill for your specialist actuarial exams.
