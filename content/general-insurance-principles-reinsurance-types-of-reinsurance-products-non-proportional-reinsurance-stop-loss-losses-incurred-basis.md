As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on the **Losses Incurred Basis** as it applies specifically to **Stop Loss Reinsurance**. Understanding this operational trigger is fundamental to pricing this type of non-proportional cover.

### **Types of Reinsurance Products**

#### **ðŸ”¹ Non-Proportional Reinsurance (Excess of Loss \- XL)**

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.4 Stop Loss Reinsurance: Operation and Basis of Cover**

Stop loss reinsurance is the widest form of aggregate excess of loss reinsurance, designed to protect an insurer's overall annual result for a specific class or its entire portfolio \[SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, 3683, SP8 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\]. It achieves this by indemnifying the ceding company against the amount by which its losses exceed a pre-agreed retention, often expressed as a percentage of premium income (a loss ratio) \[4556, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The key operational trigger for a stop loss treaty is the **losses incurred basis** \[SP8.pdf, 4553\].

###### **1\. The "Losses Incurred" Trigger**

A stop loss treaty operates based on the cedant's **losses incurred** during a specific period, which is typically 12 months \[4553, SP8.pdf\]. This is a crucial distinction from other reinsurance types that might operate on a losses occurring or claims made basis \[SP7.pdf\].

* **Definition of Losses Incurred**: Recall from our foundational notes on insurance accounting that "claims incurred" (or "losses incurred") is a key metric in the revenue account. It is defined as:

   **Claims Incurred \= Claims Paid \+ Increase in Outstanding Claims Reserves** \[8.1, 4066, SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

   This measure reflects the total cost of claims attributable to the accounting period, regardless of whether the claims have actually been paid \[8.1, 3803, 4066, SP8.pdf\].

* **Mechanism in Stop Loss**: A stop loss treaty aggregates these incurred losses over the contract period (usually a year). If this aggregate figure exceeds the retention (e.g., 110% of premium income), the reinsurance is triggered \[4553, 4556, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The reinsurer then pays the excess amount up to the treaty limit \[4556, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

###### **2\. Link to Underwriting Result and Profit Smoothing**

The use of a **losses incurred basis** is what makes stop loss a direct tool for protecting an insurer's underwriting result and smoothing its annual profits \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].

* **Underwriting Profit Calculation**: An insurer's underwriting profit is calculated as:

   **Underwriting Profit \= Earned Premiums â€“ Claims Incurred â€“ Expenses Incurred** \[8.1, 4069, SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

* **Strategic Purpose**: By capping the **losses incurred** (often via a loss ratio), the stop loss treaty directly places a floor on the potential underwriting loss for that year. This provides stability to the insurer's financial results, which is its primary purpose \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].

*Exam Coach Tip: In an SP8 exam, when discussing Stop Loss reinsurance, it is critical to state that it operates on a **losses incurred basis**. A high-scoring answer will then connect this technical detail to the commercial purpose of the product. Explain that by indemnifying the cedant for **incurred losses** above a certain loss ratio, the treaty directly protects the underwriting result and achieves the strategic goal of **profit smoothing**. This demonstrates a clear link between the operational mechanism and the business objective, a key skill for your Specialist Principles exams.*
