Of course. As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed set of notes on **Policyholder Behaviour**, focusing on the key actuarial investigations into **lapse (retention), new business (close ratio), and cancellation rates**. This is a vital topic for pricing actuaries as it directly impacts premium volume, profitability, and the accuracy of rate indications.

### **Actuarial Investigations: Analysis of Policyholder Behaviour**

Actuarial investigations into policyholder behaviour are crucial for understanding market dynamics and projecting future premium volumes and profitability. These investigations form a key part of the actuarial control cycle, allowing insurers to assess their competitive position and the impact of pricing decisions. The primary metrics analysed are retention (or lapse), close (or hit) ratios, and mid-term cancellation rates.

#### **1\. Key Metrics for Analysing Policyholder Behaviour**

Several basic insurance ratios are used to monitor and evaluate an insurer's performance in attracting and retaining customers. These metrics are closely monitored by product management and marketing departments to gauge the competitiveness of rates and service.

* **Retention Ratio (or Persistency Ratio):** This measures the rate at which existing policyholders renew their policies upon expiration. It is a primary indicator of competitiveness for the renewal book of business and is closely examined following rate changes.

  * **Formula:** `Retention Ratio = (Number of Policies Renewed) / (Number of Potential Renewal Policies)`.  
  * **Interpretation:** A high retention ratio suggests that existing customers are satisfied with the price and service. Variations exist in how this ratio is defined; for example, some insurers may exclude policies that are non-renewed by the underwriter or cancelled due to death.  
* **Close Ratio (or Hit Ratio / Conversion Rate):** This measures the rate at which prospective insureds accept a new business quote. It is a key determinant of the competitiveness of rates for new business.

  * **Formula:** `Close Ratio = (Number of Accepted Quotes) / (Number of Quotes Issued)`.  
  * **Interpretation:** A high close ratio indicates that the insurer's pricing is attractive to new customers. As with retention, the definition can vary; for instance, a prospective insured may receive multiple quotes, and companies may count this as either a single quote or multiple quotes.  
* **Mid-term Cancellation Rate:** This measures the rate at which policies are cancelled during the policy term. While not as frequently discussed as retention or close ratios, it can signal dissatisfaction or changes in the insured's circumstances. The best exposure measure for this rate is typically the mean in-force policy count over a period.

#### **2\. The Importance of Analysing Policyholder Behaviour**

Understanding policyholder behaviour is not just a marketing exercise; it has profound implications for actuarial work and an insurer's financial health.

* **Adverse and Favourable Selection:** An insurer that fails to charge equitable rates for different risk segments will be subject to adverse selection. Lower-risk insureds will leave for competitors with better pricing (impacting the **retention ratio**), while higher-risk insureds will be attracted by the under-priced rates (impacting the **close ratio**). Conversely, an insurer that accurately identifies risk characteristics can achieve favourable selection, attracting and retaining more profitable business.

* **Impact on Profitability and Expense Recovery:** Renewal customers are generally more profitable than new business customers because acquisition costs are much higher than renewal costs. Therefore, high retention is crucial for long-term profitability and ensuring that high initial expenses are recovered over the lifetime of a policy. Lifetime value analysis explicitly models renewal propensity to assess long-term profitability.

* **Informing Pricing and Business Strategy:** Monitoring these ratios helps management understand the impact of rate changes and their competitive position. A significant drop in retention or close ratios following a rate increase might lead management to moderate the implemented rate change. This analysis helps balance the actuarial indication with market realities. Price optimization techniques directly model customer demand (retention and conversion) to find rates that optimize profit and volume goals.

* **Validating Assumptions in the Actuarial Control Cycle:** The monitoring of actual retention and close ratios against expectations is a fundamental part of the actuarial control cycle. If actual experience deviates significantly from what was assumed in the pricing models, the actuary must investigate the reasons and potentially refine the assumptions for future analyses.

#### **3\. Actuarial Investigations and Methodologies**

Actuaries undertake specific investigations to understand and model policyholder behaviour.

* **Distributional and Dislocation Analysis:**

  * **Distributional analysis** examines the mix of new and renewal business by customer segment (eg, by rating factor) to identify areas of competitive strength or weakness. For instance, if an insurer has a very low share of a particular market segment, it could indicate uncompetitive rates for that group.  
  * **Dislocation analysis** quantifies the impact of a proposed rate change on existing customers' premiums. This analysis is critical because significant premium increases can trigger policyholders to shop around, negatively affecting retention. Companies often set tolerance thresholds for premium dislocation to manage this risk.  
* **Customer Demand Modelling (Retention and Conversion Models):**

  * Sophisticated insurers use multivariate statistical techniques, such as Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), to build customer demand models.  
  * **Retention models** predict the probability that an existing customer will renew, based on factors like the size of the rate change, risk characteristics, and price competitiveness.  
  * **Conversion (or close ratio) models** predict the probability that a prospective customer will accept a quote.  
  * These models allow insurers to systematically test different rate scenarios and select a final rate structure that optimally balances actuarial cost indications with customer demand to meet profitability and volume targets.  
* **Lifetime Value (LTV) Analysis:**

  * This technique moves beyond a single policy period to examine the profitability of a customer over a longer time horizon, explicitly incorporating persistency (ie, the probability of renewal).  
  * By factoring in renewal probabilities, LTV analysis provides a more complete picture of profitability, recognising that acquiring a customer who is likely to remain loyal for many years can be more valuable than acquiring one who is likely to lapse after the first year, even if the first-year profit is lower.

In summary, the analysis of policyholder behaviour—through metrics like retention, close, and cancellation rates—is a fundamental actuarial investigation. It directly informs pricing strategy, protects against adverse selection, and is a key component of modern, sophisticated pricing techniques like price optimization and lifetime value analysis.
