As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on **Underwriting Factors**, placing them within the larger context of **Rating Factors**. It is essential to understand the distinction between risk factors, rating factors, and underwriting factors, as this clarifies the entire premium-setting process from objective data analysis to the final subjective judgement made by the underwriter.

### **Key Product Features: Rating Factors and Underwriting Factors**

In pricing general insurance, insurers move from a simple exposure measure to a sophisticated pricing structure using various factors to ensure premiums are equitable, competitive, and sufficient to cover the underlying risk. This process involves identifying true risk drivers (risk factors), using measurable proxies for them (rating factors), and applying final judgement (underwriting factors).

#### **1\. Differentiating Key Terminology**

To understand the full context, it's vital to differentiate between three related concepts:

* **Risk Factors**: These are the true, underlying characteristics that have a genuine impact on the expected frequency or severity of claims. Many risk factors, such as "driving skill" or "quality of business management," are abstract, subjective, and difficult to measure objectively.  
* **Rating Factors**: These are the specific, measurable, and verifiable characteristics that insurers actually use in their premium calculations. A good rating factor is either a directly measurable risk factor or, more commonly, a reliable proxy for underlying risks. For instance, No-Claim Discount (NCD) is a rating factor used as a proxy for driving skill. The primary function of a rating structure is to categorize policyholders into homogeneous risk groups.  
* **Underwriting Factors**: This is the broadest term. It encompasses all objective rating factors *plus* any subjective judgements that an underwriter might apply when assessing a risk and setting the final premium or policy conditions.

In essence, while all rating factors are underwriting factors, not all underwriting factors are rating factors because underwriting includes a layer of professional judgement that goes beyond the objective data inputs of a rating model.

#### **2\. The Role of Underwriting Factors in Pricing**

The role and importance of subjective underwriting factors vary significantly depending on the class of business.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.1 Personal Lines and Small Commercial Risks**

For personal lines (like private motor and household insurance) and small commercial risks, the pricing process is highly automated and relies almost exclusively on objective **rating factors**. Underwriting is largely based on statistics, and individual risks are not typically referred to an underwriter unless they are exceptional or very large. In these cases, the underwriting process is essentially the application of the predefined rating structure. Sophisticated multivariate analyses like Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) are used to determine the relativities for a large number of rating factors simultaneously.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.2 Large Commercial Risks**

For large, complex, or unique risks, the role of the underwriter and their subjective judgement becomes paramount. While some objective rating factors are still used, the final premium is heavily influenced by the underwriter's qualitative assessment. The pricing actuary's role in this context often involves providing a technical rate as a starting point, but the underwriter applies their expertise to adjust it.

Examples of subjective underwriting factors for large commercial risks include:

* **Qualitative Impressions**: An underwriter for a large industrial fire risk will consider the nature of adjacent buildings or how well a company is managed. A tightly-run factory with disciplined procedures is considered less risky.  
* **Risk Management Standards**: The quality of a client's risk management, such as health and safety training or the installation of sprinkler systems, is a key underwriting factor. This improves claims experience and reduces the premium.  
* **General Assessment of the Client**: The underwriter will form a view on the client's attitude to risk, their claims history (especially for smaller claims), and any significant changes in their business operations (like mergers or acquisitions) that might alter their risk profile.  
* **Market Conditions**: An underwriter's final decision is influenced by market dynamics, the competitive environment, and the insurer's own risk appetite.

For these types of risks, each policy is individually underwritten, allowing the underwriter to be flexible in tailoring the cover and pricing to the specific client's needs.

#### **3\. Underwriting Factors by Line of Business**

* **Commercial Liability (Employers' and Public Liability)**: The primary risk factor is the nature of the insured's business. Key underwriting factors include the industry type, the company's past claims experience, specific processes and materials handled, and the quality of its safety precautions.  
* **Professional Indemnity / Directors' & Officers' (D\&O) Liability**: Each policy is typically underwritten individually. The main underwriting factors are the nature of the profession or company being insured and its past experience. For Employment Practices Liability (EPL), the underwriter must also consider the current legal environment and the specific industry being covered.  
* **Large Industrial Fire**: Underwriting is a skilled job based on detailed reports from surveyors and fire officers. Subjective underwriting factors include the quality of the company's management and its risk management standards.

*Exam Coach Tip: For SP8, it's crucial to understand that the pricing process isn't always a purely formulaic exercise. While your focus will often be on quantitative methods like GLMs which use **rating factors**, you must also appreciate where **underwriting factors** (subjective judgement) come into play. In an exam question about pricing a large or unique commercial risk, a high-quality answer will distinguish between the technical premium calculated by the actuary and the final premium set by the underwriter, highlighting the qualitative, subjective underwriting factors that influence the final decision.*
