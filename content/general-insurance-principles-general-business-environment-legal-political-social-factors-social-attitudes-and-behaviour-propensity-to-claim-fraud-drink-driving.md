As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, the analysis of **Social Attitudes and Behaviour** is crucial, as these factors, alongside legal and political changes, directly influence the operational environment, claims patterns, and the inherent uncertainty in pricing. Societal trends affect the frequency and cost of claims by altering how individuals behave, their willingness to seek compensation, and their views on insurance fraud.

## **Social Attitudes and Behaviour Affecting Claims**

### **I. Increasing Propensity to Claim (Litigiousness)**

Societal trends indicate an increasing willingness among people and organizations to pursue legal remedies, dramatically impacting liability classes.

1. **Increasing Litigiousness:** It has been observed that society is becoming increasingly litigious. This trend, sometimes referred to as an increasing **'compensation culture'**, reflects a growing acceptance of seeking compensation and looking for someone to blame for suffering.  
2. **Frequency and Severity Impact:** This societal trend acts to increase both the **frequency** (more cases brought) and the **severity** (higher awards sought and granted) of liability claims.  
3. **Facilitation by Third Parties:** This movement is often accelerated by organizations, known as claim management or accident management companies ('ambulance chasers'), which encourage the placing (making) of claims. These firms actively encourage individuals to pursue compensation claims and may organize lawyers and experts on the claimantâ€™s behalf.  
4. **Legislative Influence:** This trend was particularly reinforced by legislative changes, such as making it legal for lawyers to work on a **no-win-no-fee** basis in the UK, which led to a large number of extra legal cases seeking compensation for injuries.  
5. **Focus on Latent Claims:** Organizations encouraging claims often concentrate on liability for **latent claims** (those manifesting long after the cause, e.g., asbestos-related illnesses). The actions of lawyers actively seeking out victims increase claim frequency and may affect severity, particularly by increasing general awareness and awards made by courts.

### **II. Attitude Towards Fraud and Moral Hazard**

Social and economic pressures directly influence policyholders' honesty, leading to increased claims cost and uncertainty.

1. **View of Fraud:** Surveys suggest that people often view fraudulent claiming, especially the **exaggeration of a genuine claim**, as a minor offense, if an offense at all. This behavioral tendency is a form of **moral hazard**.  
2. **Cost and Detection:** This behavior increases claims costs because these claims are often impossible or uneconomic to detect, increasing the expense of claims handling. New processes, such as online claim reporting services, may also cause an increase in fraudulent behaviour, potentially increasing both frequency and severity.  
3. **Economic Stringency:** Fraudulent claiming tends to be greatest during periods of **economic downturn and depression**. The rate of fraudulent claims has been observed to **increase in times of economic stringency**.  
   * The insured may see the insurer as an illegal means of recovering losses that threaten their financial position when facing economic hardship.  
   * Examples of recession-linked increases include claims for **theft and arson**, and deliberate attempts by businesses to exaggerate losses (e.g., falsification of accounts).

### **III. Specific Behavioural Trends (e.g., Drink Driving)**

Societal attitudes can also shift behavior in ways that positively or negatively affect claim experience, often reinforced by legislation.

1. **Drink Driving Attitude Change:** Historically, driving while drunk was sometimes viewed as socially acceptable, with those prosecuted regarded as unlucky. However, attitudes have changed, and it is now generally regarded as unacceptable behavior.  
2. **Claims Reduction:** This shift in societal attitude should lead to drink driving being less frequent, resulting in **fewer and less serious accidents** (reduced frequency and severity), thereby lowering the cost of motor insurance claims.  
3. **Legislative Reinforcement:** This trend was supported by legislation, including reducing the permissible alcohol limit, introducing random breath tests, and increasing penalties and enforcement resources. Insurers also reinforced this by strictly enforcing policy clauses to remove cover for drunk drivers (beyond mandatory legal requirements).

### **IV. Implications for Pricing and Uncertainty**

The inherent unpredictability of these social and behavioral factors introduces significant uncertainty into actuarial estimates.

* **Adjustment of Data:** If an actuary expects a change in the extent of fraudulent or exaggerated claims due to changing attitudes, they **should make adjustments** to historical data to allow for this.  
* **Uncertainty Loadings:** Because changes in behaviour and awareness are difficult to predict in terms of timing and extent, they contribute to a **continuing uncertainty** as to the number and cost of future claims. This requires actuaries to incorporate **additional contingency loadings** (higher risk margins) in premiums, particularly where legislation restricts the use of accurate rating factors.  
* **ENIDs:** Social trends can result in new types of claims emerging that were not present in historical data (Events Not In Data), which must be considered in capital modeling and pricing.
