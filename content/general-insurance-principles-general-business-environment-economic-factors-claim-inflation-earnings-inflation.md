This discussion addresses **Earnings Inflation** as a critical economic factor within the General Insurance Business Environment. For SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, recognizing how earnings inflation specifically drives claims cost is paramount, especially for liability and property damage classes, ensuring premium adequacy and accurate reserving.

## **Earnings Inflation within the Claims Inflation Environment**

Claims inflation refers to the ongoing increase in the cost of settling insurance claims. Earnings inflation, which refers to the increase in wages and salaries, is one of the distinct types of inflation that drives this claims severity. Failure to anticipate appropriate levels of inflation, including earnings inflation, can lead to inadequate premiums and under-reserving.

### **I. Impact on Claims Severity (Labor and Repair Costs)**

Earnings inflation primarily affects claim costs that have a significant labor component, particularly in property and motor repair services.

1. **Property Repair Costs:** For claims involving the repair or rebuilding of private, commercial, and industrial property, **labour will be a major part of the claims costs**. This cost is highly correlated with wages, and since wages tend to increase more than general prices, the overall cost of this insurance is likely to increase more than general price inflation alone.  
2. **Motor Repair Costs:** A large proportion of motor claims cost relates to vehicle repair. Since motor repair is labor-intensive, these costs are primarily affected by the level of earnings (wage indices).

### **II. Critical Role in Liability Claims (Loss of Income)**

Earnings inflation is a fundamental component of liability claims, particularly those involving long-term bodily injury, due to compensation for loss of income.

1. **Compensation for Loss of Income:** Earnings inflation affects claims for loss of earnings. Personal injury claims generally include compensation for loss of income, which is subject to the **same inflation indices as other income-related costs**.  
2. **Judicial Assessment:** Claim payments intended to represent the future lost earnings of an individual are typically based on the present value of that future income. These calculations rely on assumptions, such as the **employment risk assumption** in the Ogden tables (UK context), which allows for the risk that the individual might have been unable to work due to sickness, unemployment, or retirement, even if the accident had not occurred.  
3. **Exposure Measurement:** For classes like Employers' Liability (EL), where claim settlements are often related to loss of earnings, **payroll (or total wage and salary costs)** is used as the main exposure measure. This choice ensures that the compensation payable to employees is proportional to the premium base, reflecting the risk exposure to earnings inflation.

### **III. Influence on Insurer Expenses**

The structure of the insurance industry means that the insurer's own operating costs are highly sensitive to earnings inflation.

1. **Labor-Intensive Industry:** Insurance is a relatively labor-intensive industry. Therefore, the cost loading for an insurance policy (expenses) is likely to increase in line with **wage inflation**.  
2. **Expense Components:** Expenses are likely to be linked primarily to wage inflation, although they may also be related to price inflation to some extent. Salary inflation forms the bulk of a general insurance companyâ€™s general office expenses. Salary inflation is also the most important factor for claim expenses.

### **IV. Relationship to Other Economic Factors and Pricing**

Earnings inflation must be coordinated with other economic trends, particularly when projecting costs for long-tailed business.

1. **Correlation with Price Inflation:** Earnings inflation is generally expected to **exceed price inflation in the long run**. Actuaries sometimes assume a fairly stable relationship between the two, such as a 2% gap.  
2. **Comparison to Judicial Inflation:** Judicial inflation (court award inflation) tends to be higher than general price or wage inflation. Court awards for pain and suffering have grown at a faster rate than general price or wage inflation.  
3. **Coordination with Interest/Discount Rates:** If high interest rates are allowed for in pricing, it is crucial that the projected claims reflect a **consistent level of inflation**. The interest rate used to discount future claims, particularly for long-term bodily injury, is highly sensitive to legislative changes (e.g., changes to the Ogden tables), which drastically affect the present value of future earnings replacement.  
4. **Reinsurance Indexation:** Earnings inflation is explicitly used in reinsurance contracts, particularly in the London Market, to preserve the real value of cover. The standard London Market indexation clause (LMIC94) indexes the limit and retention in line with **average earnings** up to the time the claim is settled, using specified earnings indices.
