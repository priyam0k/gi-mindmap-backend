As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on **Reinstatement**. This is a critical operational clause within **Excess of Loss (XL) Reinsurance** and understanding its mechanics is essential for pricing these complex contracts, a core skill for the SP8 exam \[SP8.pdf\].

### **Types of Reinsurance Products**

#### **ðŸ”¹ Non-Proportional Reinsurance (Excess of Loss \- XL)**

##### **ðŸ”¸ Operation: Key Treaty Clauses**

###### **ðŸ”¹ Reinstatements**

##### **1\. Definition and Purpose**

**Definition**: A reinstatement is the restoration of the full reinsurance cover following a claim that has eroded or fully exhausted the limit of an Excess of Loss (XL) layer \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. The treaty document will specify the number of reinstatements allowed and the terms upon which they are made \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. Once agreed, the reinstatement is automatic and obligatory for both the cedant and the reinsurer; there are no options involved \[SP7.pdf\].

**Purpose**: The primary purpose of a reinstatement provision is to ensure that the ceding insurer has continuous protection against further large or catastrophic losses throughout the policy year, even after an initial loss has occurred \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. Without reinstatement, an insurer could find itself dangerously exposed after a single significant event early in the year.

##### **2\. Operational Mechanism: The Reinstatement Premium**

When a reinstatement is triggered, the ceding insurer is often required to pay an additional premium, known as a **reinstatement premium**, to the reinsurer to restore the cover \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].

* **Calculation**: The reinstatement premium is typically calculated based on the proportion of the layer that has been used up by the claim and sometimes also on the remaining period of cover \[SP7.pdf\]. A common approach is to charge the premium *pro-rata as to amount*, meaning if a claim uses 50% of the reinsurance layer, the reinstatement premium would be 50% of the full reinstatement premium \[SP7.pdf\]. The treaty may also specify calculation *pro-rata as to time* \[SP7.pdf\].

* **Payment**: In practice, reinstatement premiums are often deducted directly from the claim recovery paid by the reinsurer to the cedant, which simplifies the administration of the cashflows \[SP7.pdf\].

* **Pricing**: The full reinstatement premium for restoring the entire layer is often expressed as a percentage of the original reinsurance premium (e.g., "one reinstatement at 100% additional premium") \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

##### **3\. Reinstatement Terms and Layer Characteristics**

The terms of reinstatementâ€”specifically the number of reinstatements allowed and whether they are free or paidâ€”are heavily influenced by where the XL layer sits in the reinsurance programme.

* **Working Layers**: These are the lower layers of cover, just above the cedant's retention, where claims are expected with moderate to heavy frequency \[SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. Because these layers are expected to be used regularly, they often have more generous terms, such as **unlimited free reinstatements**, to ensure the cedant has continuous protection for frequently occurring large losses \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Higher Layers**: These layers protect against less frequent but more severe catastrophic events. They typically have a **limited number of paid reinstatements** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. For example, a contract might allow for "one reinstatement at 100% additional premium" or "two reinstatements, the first at 120% and the second at 150%" \[SP8.pdf\].

##### **4\. Numerical Example**

Consider a â‚¬2m xs â‚¬1m XL treaty with the following terms \[SP8.pdf\]:

* Up-front (original) premium: â‚¬200,000  
* Reinstatements allowed: 2 (the first at 120% additional premium, the second at 150%)

The following claims occur chronologically \[SP8.pdf\]:

1. **Loss of â‚¬2.5m**: The recovery is â‚¬1.5m (â‚¬2.5m \- â‚¬1m). This uses up 75% of the â‚¬2m layer. A reinstatement premium of `0.75 * 1.20 * â‚¬200,000 = â‚¬180,000` is paid to restore the cover \[SP8.pdf\].  
2. **Loss of â‚¬5m**: The recovery is the full â‚¬2.0m layer. A reinstatement premium is paid to restore cover for the second time. The premium is calculated using both the remaining portion of the first reinstatement and the full amount of the second: `(0.25 * 1.20 * â‚¬200,000) + (1.00 * 1.50 * â‚¬200,000) = â‚¬60,000 + â‚¬300,000 = â‚¬360,000`. (Note: different sources might show slightly different calculation methods for this second reinstatement) \[SP8.pdf\].  
3. **Loss of â‚¬2m**: The recovery is â‚¬1.0m (â‚¬2m \- â‚¬1m). A reinstatement premium is paid using the second reinstatement term: `0.50 * 1.50 * â‚¬200,000 = â‚¬150,000`. The remaining cover is now â‚¬1.0m \[SP8.pdf\].  
4. **Loss of â‚¬8m**: The recovery is limited to the remaining â‚¬1.0m of cover. No further reinstatements are available, so the insurer is exposed to any subsequent large losses for the rest of the year \[SP8.pdf\].

*Exam Coach Tip: Questions on XL reinsurance pricing or operation frequently involve reinstatements. A strong SP8 answer must not only define reinstatement but also explain its commercial purposeâ€”to provide continuous cover. For higher marks, you must be able to link the reinstatement terms to the type of layer (unlimited free for working layers vs. limited paid for higher layers). Be prepared to perform a numerical calculation like the one above, carefully tracking how each claim erodes the layer and triggers a reinstatement premium, and keeping a running total of the remaining cover available. This demonstrates a practical, in-depth understanding of how these contracts are priced and how they respond to loss events.*
