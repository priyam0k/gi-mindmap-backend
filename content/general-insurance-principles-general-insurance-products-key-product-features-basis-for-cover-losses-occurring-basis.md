As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note sequence on the **Losses-Occurring Basis**, positioning it within the larger context of a product's **Basis for Cover**. This is a fundamental concept for SP8, as the basis of cover dictates *when* a policy responds to a claim, which has significant implications for pricing, reserving (SP7), and managing long-tail risk \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **The Larger Context: Basis for Cover as a Key Product Feature**

When we analyse any general insurance product, the **Basis for Cover** is one of the six key features we must identify \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. It is a crucial legal and technical feature, defined in the policy document, that specifies the trigger for a policy's response to a claim \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The two primary bases are:

1. **Losses-Occurring Basis** (also called Claims-Occurring)  
2. **Claims-Made Basis** (also called Claims-Reported)

The choice between these two fundamentally alters the risk profile of a product, particularly for long-tail classes of business \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

### **1\. Defining the Losses-Occurring Basis**

**A losses-occurring policy provides cover for losses that *occur* during the defined policy period, regardless of when the claim is eventually reported to the insurer** \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This is the more traditional form of cover \[SP752.pdf\].

* **Practical Example:** If a policy runs from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, it will be liable for any valid claims arising from events that happened within that specific period \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. It makes no difference whether the policyholder reports the claim in 2023, 2024, or even decades later in the case of latent diseases like asbestosis \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **2\. Risks and Implications for the Insurer**

The losses-occurring basis creates significant challenges for the insurer, especially for long-tail liability business. These are critical concepts for your SP8, SP7, and SA3 exams.

* **IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) Risk:** This basis exposes the insurer to substantial IBNR risk \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. Claims may not be reported for many years, creating high uncertainty when estimating the required reserves for past policy years \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\]. This makes managing the business effectively very difficult \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Latent Claims:** The losses-occurring basis is severely challenged by latent claims, where the delay between the cause of the loss (eg, exposure to asbestos) and the claim notification can be several decades \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This means an insurer remains potentially liable for policies written a very long time ago \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

* **Defining the "Accident Date":** For industrial diseases that result from prolonged exposure over many years, it is often very difficult to define a single "accident date" \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. In these situations, a legally imposed or industry-agreed method is often needed to allocate the claim cost between different policy years and, potentially, different insurers \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **3\. Common Product Applications**

The losses-occurring basis is the standard and often legally required basis for many common types of general insurance products.

* **Property Damage Insurance:** This is the standard basis for most property damage policies, like motor own damage or household insurance \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. For these short-tail classes, the IBNR risk is much less of a concern.

* **Compulsory Liability Classes:** In many jurisdictions, this basis is legally required for compulsory insurance. A key example is UK **Employers’ Liability (EL)** \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Other Liability Classes:** It is the usual basis of cover for **Motor Third Party Liability (MTPL)** and **Public Liability** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **4\. Contrast with Claims-Made Basis**

Understanding the losses-occurring basis is best reinforced by contrasting it with the claims-made basis, which was developed partly in response to the challenges posed by latent claims \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

| Feature | Losses-Occurring Basis | Claims-Made Basis |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Trigger** | Loss event must **occur** during the policy period \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. | Claim must be **reported** to the insurer during the policy period \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. |
| **IBNR Risk for Insurer** | High, especially for long-tail and latent claims. The insurer is exposed to claims reported many years after the policy has expired \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. | Low "pure IBNR" risk, as late-reported claims fall on subsequent policies. Provides greater certainty for the insurer \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. |
| **Risk for Policyholder** | Provides more comprehensive cover, as there are no gaps if the insurer is changed \[SP752.pdf\]. | Can be unsatisfactory, as it may be difficult to secure continuous cover if latent claims begin to emerge \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. |
| **Common Products** | Motor Third Party Liability, Public Liability, UK Employers’ Liability, Property Damage \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. | Professional Indemnity, Directors' & Officers' Liability, Product Liability \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP437.pdf, SP3628.pdf\]. |

For your SP8 exam, being able to articulate these differences and their impact on risk, data requirements, and pricing assumptions is a core skill. The choice of basis fundamentally shapes the insurer's exposure over time.
