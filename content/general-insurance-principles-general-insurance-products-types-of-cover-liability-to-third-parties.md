As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a comprehensive set of notes on **Liability to Third Parties**, positioning this as a fundamental category within the broader context of **Types of Cover** in general insurance, based on the provided sources.

### **1\. Defining Liability to Third Parties**

Liability insurance is a cornerstone of the general insurance market, addressing a critical need for both individuals and businesses. The essential characteristic of this type of cover is to **provide indemnity** where the insured is legally liable to pay compensation to a third party. This legal liability typically arises from a **tort**, which is a private or civil wrong, such as negligence. The cover protects the policyholder against potentially very large or even unlimited financial losses stemming from legal action.

The benefit provided is an amount to fully indemnify the policyholder against their financial loss, which includes not only the compensation award but usually also any associated legal expenses. However, this benefit can be restricted by policy terms such as excesses, deductibles, and maximum indemnity limits per claim, per event, or in aggregate per year.

### **2\. Risks and Characteristics for the Insurer**

The sources consistently highlight that liability business is one of the riskiest categories for an insurer, demanding significant capital backing. Key characteristics include:

* **Long-tail Nature**: This is the most significant feature. There are often considerable delays between the event causing the claim and its final settlement. It can take many years to establish liability, quantify the loss, and make the final payment, particularly for bodily injury claims or latent diseases. This long tail creates substantial uncertainty for both reserving (SP7) and pricing (SP8).  
* **High Severity & Volatility**: While claims may be relatively infrequent compared to property lines, they can be extremely large and have widely spread cost distributions. The potential for unlimited cover, particularly in compulsory classes, exacerbates this risk.  
* **Inflation Sensitivity**: Liability classes are highly exposed to various forms of inflation, especially "social inflation," where court awards increase faster than general price or wage inflation. Judicial decisions and legislative changes can have a dramatic and often retrospective impact on claims costs.  
* **Capital Requirements**: The combination of a long tail, high severity, and volatility means that liability insurance requires a significant amount of capital to support the business and maintain solvency.

### **3\. Basis of Cover**

Liability insurance can be written on different bases, which fundamentally changes when a policy responds to a claim:

* **Losses-Occurring Basis**: This is the traditional form, where the policy provides cover for losses occurring during the defined policy period, regardless of when the claim is reported. This is the standard for classes like Motor Third Party Liability and is legally required for UK Employers' Liability. The major challenge for insurers is the IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) risk, especially for latent claims which may not be reported for decades.  
* **Claims-Made Basis**: This basis covers claims that are *reported* to the insurer during the policy period, irrespective of when the loss event occurred. It is the standard form for Professional Indemnity, D\&O, and Product Liability. This basis helps insurers by reducing the tail risk associated with late-reported claims (the pure IBNR), as late claims fall on subsequent policies. However, from the policyholder's perspective, it can create issues in securing continuous cover if latent claims begin to emerge.

### **4\. Principal Products providing Liability Cover**

The sources identify several key insurance products that fall under the liability category:

* **Employers’ Liability (EL) / Workers' Compensation**: Indemnifies an employer against legal liability to compensate an employee for bodily injury, disease, or death arising from the employer's negligence. In many countries, like the UK, this cover is compulsory. It is a classic long-tail class due to industrial diseases like asbestosis, which have long latency periods. The main exposure measure is payroll.  
* **Motor Third Party Liability (MTPL)**: Indemnifies a vehicle owner against compensation payable to third parties for personal injury or property damage. This is also compulsory in most countries, often with unlimited cover for personal injury. While property damage claims are short-tailed, the bodily injury component makes the class long-tailed overall.  
* **Public and Product Liability**: Public liability covers the insured's legal liability for injury or damage to third parties arising from their premises or business operations. Product liability covers liability arising from a faulty product. Both are typically long-tailed, and turnover is the most common exposure measure.  
* **Professional Indemnity (PI) / Errors & Omissions (E\&O)**: Indemnifies a professional firm (e.g., actuaries, solicitors, doctors) against losses resulting from negligence in the provision of their service. It is typically written on a claims-made basis.  
* **Directors’ & Officers’ (D\&O) Liability**: Indemnifies directors against legal liability arising from wrongful acts committed in their capacity as company officers. It is also usually written on a claims-made basis. A specific form of D\&O is **Employment Practices Liability (EPL)**, which covers claims related to employment practices like unfair dismissal or discrimination and is now commonly sold as a standalone product.
