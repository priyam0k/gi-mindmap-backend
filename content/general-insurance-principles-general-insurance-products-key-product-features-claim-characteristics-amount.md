As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed note on claim amounts, or severity, as a crucial component within the broader topic of **Claim Characteristics**. This topic builds on our previous discussion about claim delays (short vs long-tail business) and is fundamental to pricing, reserving, and capital management.

### **Claim Characteristics: Claim Amount (Severity)**

In addition to the timing of claims (delays), the size or quantum of a claim is a critical characteristic that defines the risk profile of an insurance product. Claim severity refers to the cost of a single claim and, like claim frequency and delays, it varies significantly by class of business. Understanding the distribution of claim amounts is essential for actuaries in pricing, setting reserves, assessing capital needs, and designing appropriate reinsurance programmes.

#### **1\. General Features of Claim Amounts**

The cost of a claim for any given policy is rarely predetermined, except in fixed-benefit classes like personal accident insurance. For most classes, the basis of cover is indemnity, meaning the insurer aims to restore the policyholder to their financial position before the loss occurred. While a policy will often state a maximum sum insured, most claims are settled for only a portion of this maximum, depending on the specifics of the incident.

The probability distribution used to represent claim sizes is conventionally a highly skewed distribution with no theoretical upper limit, such as a lognormal or Pareto distribution. This reflects a common feature across most classes: a large proportion of claims are for small amounts (often called **attritional claims**), with only a small number of very **large claims**. However, the precise shape of this distribution varies greatly by class.

#### **2\. Factors Influencing Claim Amount**

Various factors, both external and internal to the insurer, influence the ultimate cost of claims.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.1 Inflation**

Inflation has a direct impact on claim severity. Different types of inflation affect different classes of business:

* **Price Inflation**: Affects the replacement cost of goods, impacting classes like **Household Contents** insurance.  
* **Earnings / Wage Inflation**: Affects repair costs (due to labour charges) and compensation for loss of earnings. This is significant for **Motor Property Damage** and personal injury claims under **Liability** policies.  
* **Medical Inflation**: Persistently higher than general inflation due to more advanced (and expensive) treatments and increased life expectancy of injured parties. This is a key driver for medical expense claims and bodily injury claims.  
* **Court Award Inflation / Social Inflation**: Particularly relevant for liability classes, this reflects the trend in many countries towards more generous compensation awards for pain and suffering, which often grow faster than general price or wage inflation.

For pricing and reserving, it's crucial to consider the time period over which inflation will apply. For long-tail business, claims may be settled many years after the policy was written, experiencing much heavier inflation than that prevailing at the point of writing.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.2 Judicial Decisions and Legislation**

Court awards have the most significant impact on **Liability** insurance claims. They can affect both the frequency and severity of claims, and a single court decision can set a precedent for future awards and out-of-court settlements. Key drivers include:

* **Heads of Damage**: Compensation for major injuries is often split into components like loss of income, medical costs, and pain and suffering. The emergence of new heads of damage (e.g., 'bullying' or 'post traumatic stress disorder') increases overall claim costs.  
* **Punitive Damages**: These are damages intended to punish the tortfeasor beyond simple compensation. While rare in some jurisdictions (like the UK), they are common in the US and can lead to very large awards.  
* **Structured Settlements / PPOs**: Legislation in some countries allows or requires courts to award compensation for future losses (like loss of earnings) as a series of regular payments (an annuity) rather than a lump sum. This can increase the ultimate cost to the insurer due to administrative costs, the price of purchasing annuities, and longevity risk.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.3 Demand Surge**

Following a major catastrophe, there is often a temporary increase in the costs of materials, labour, and services due to a sudden spike in demand and/or reduction in supply. This "demand surge" can significantly inflate the cost of claims beyond what would normally be expected. This is particularly relevant for property classes affected by natural disasters.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.4 Fraud**

Fraudulent claims can affect both frequency and severity. Policyholders may make false claims or, more commonly, exaggerate the amount of a genuine claim. This risk is higher during periods of economic hardship and for certain classes, such as household contents where it is difficult for the insurer to verify the value of all claimed items.

#### **3\. Claim Amount Characteristics by Line of Business**

##### **ðŸ”¸ 3.1 Property Damage Business**

Property damage claims are generally considered **short-tail**, meaning they are reported and settled quickly. The claim cost distribution is typically less widely spread than for liability business.

* **Household and Commercial Property**: Claims tend to be fairly consistent in size, with a small number of larger, total loss claims and occasional liability losses. Commercial property claims have a more scattered cost distribution due to the unique nature of the properties insured.  
* **Motor Property Damage**: The average claim size is relatively small, with the maximum benefit typically limited to the depreciated value of the vehicle.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 3.2 Liability Business**

Most liability classes are **long-tail**, characterised by significant delays in settlement. The claim cost distributions are typically more widely spread than for property classes, with the potential for extremely large individual claims that can take many years to settle.

* **Employers' Liability / Workers' Compensation**: Claim sizes have huge variation, with a few very large claims making up a large proportion of the total claim amount. The potential for latent disease claims (e.g., asbestos) adds another layer of high severity risk.  
* **Motor Third Party Liability**: While many claims are for property damage and are relatively small, claims involving serious bodily injury can be very large, running into millions of pounds or dollars.  
* **Professional Indemnity / D\&O**: The size of claims can be very large, reflecting the significant financial losses that can result from professional negligence or wrongful acts by directors.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 3.3 Financial Loss Business**

This category is generally **short-tailed**, though some policies can have long terms.

* **Mortgage Indemnity**: Claim experience is heavily dependent on economic factors. Claim amounts are driven by the difference between the property's resale value and the outstanding loan, which can be significant in a housing market downturn.  
* **Business Interruption**: The financial consequences can be much more significant than the cost of the underlying physical damage, as the claim covers the loss of income until the business can resume normal operations.

*Exam Coach Tip: When a question asks you to discuss a specific insurance product, always consider its claim characteristics. Is it short-tail or long-tail? What is the nature of its claim amount distribution (e.g., high frequency/low severity vs. low frequency/high severity)? What are the key drivers of claim cost, such as inflation types or legal changes? This framework will allow you to build a structured and comprehensive answer covering pricing, reserving, and capital considerations.*
