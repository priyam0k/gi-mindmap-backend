As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note on **Basis for Cover**, placing it within the larger context of the **Key Product Features** that define general insurance products. For your SP8 exam, understanding this feature is absolutely critical, especially for liability classes, as it determines precisely *when* a policy responds to a claim, which has significant implications for pricing, reserving, and managing long-tail risk \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **The Larger Context: The Six Key Product Features**

When analysing any general insurance product, we break it down into six fundamental features to understand the risks involved for the insurer \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The Basis for Cover is one of these six core components:

1. Benefits Provided  
2. Insured Perils  
3. **Basis for Cover**  
4. Measures of Exposure  
5. Claim Characteristics  
6. Risk and Rating Factors

The Basis for Cover is a crucial legal and technical feature defined in the **Policy Document** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. It specifies the temporal trigger for a policy's response, which is a key distinction, particularly for long-tail classes of business \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **1\. Defining "Basis for Cover"**

The Basis for Cover determines the point in time that triggers a specific policy to respond to a claim \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The sources describe two primary bases of cover used in the general insurance market:

1. **Losses-Occurring Basis** (also called Claims-Occurring)  
2. **Claims-Made Basis** (also called Claims-Reported)

Let's examine each in detail.

#### **1.1 Losses-Occurring Basis**

* **Definition:** A losses-occurring policy provides cover for losses that **occur during the defined policy period**, regardless of when the claim is eventually reported to the insurer \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

* **How it Works:** If a policy runs from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, it will cover any valid claims from events that happened within that period. It does not matter if the claim is reported in 2023, 2024, or even decades later in the case of latent diseases \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

* **Risks and Implications for the Insurer:**

  * **IBNR (Incurred But Not Reported) Risk:** This basis exposes the insurer to significant IBNR risk. For long-tail classes, claims may not be reported for many years, creating substantial uncertainty in estimating the required reserves \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
  * **Latent Claims:** The losses-occurring basis is particularly challenged by latent claims (eg, asbestos-related diseases), where the delay between the cause of loss (exposure) and the claim can be several decades \[SP7.pdf, SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This makes it very difficult for the insurer to manage the business effectively \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
  * **Defining the "Accident Date":** For industrial diseases resulting from prolonged exposure, it can be very difficult to define a specific "accident date". In these cases, a legally imposed or industry-agreed method of allocating the claim between different policy years (and different insurers) is often necessary \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Common Product Applications:**

  * This is the standard basis for most **Property Damage** insurance \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
  * It is legally required in some jurisdictions for compulsory classes like UK **Employersâ€™ Liability** \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
  * It is the usual basis for **Motor Third Party Liability** and **Public Liability** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

#### **1.2 Claims-Made Basis**

* **Definition:** A claims-made policy covers claims that are **first reported to the insurer during the policy period**, irrespective of when the loss event actually occurred \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].

* **How it Works:** If a policy runs from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023, it will cover any valid claims notified to the insurer during that year. The event causing the claim could have happened in 2023, 2022, or many years prior, as long as it is after any specified **retroactive date** \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Risks and Implications for the Insurer:**

  * **Reduced Tail Risk:** The main advantage for the insurer is that this basis reduces the long-tail risk associated with late-reported claims. The "pure IBNR" risk is effectively removed, as late claims fall onto subsequent policies, not the original one \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This provides the insurer with greater certainty.  
  * **IBNER Risk:** While pure IBNR is reduced, the insurer is still exposed to IBNER (Incurred But Not Enough Reported) risk, as the value of claims reported during the year may still develop over time \[SP752.pdf\].  
  * **Discovery Period / Sunset Clause:** To manage the risk of very old events being claimed, a policy may include a **discovery period** (defined in a **sunset clause**). This is a time limit that prevents claims being made many years after the event that caused the claim \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Implications for the Policyholder:**

  * The cover granted may be unsatisfactory from the policyholder's perspective, as they may have trouble obtaining continuous cover if latent claims begin to emerge. If an employer knows workers have been exposed to hazardous conditions, future insurers will be very reluctant to offer affordable or comprehensive cover \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Common Product Applications:**

  * This basis was developed partly as a response to the problems of latent claims under losses-occurring policies \[SP752.pdf, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
  * It is the standard form for **Professional Indemnity (E\&O)**, **Directors' & Officers' (D\&O)** liability, **Employment Practices Liability (EPL)**, and **Product Liability** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP437.pdf, SP3628.pdf\].

### **Exam Focus: Why the Basis of Cover is a Crucial Feature**

For your SP8 exam, being able to distinguish between these two bases and articulate their impact is a core skill. Here's a summary of the key takeaways:

* **Impact on Claim Characteristics:** The basis of cover fundamentally alters the **claim characteristics**, particularly the length of the tail. A claims-made basis shortens the reporting tail for the insurer, making the business less risky from this perspective \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
* **Relevance to Product Type:** The choice of basis is strongly linked to the type of product. Property lines are almost always losses-occurring. Long-tail liability lines, especially those with potential for latent claims (eg, professional services, faulty products), have increasingly moved to a claims-made basis to improve manageability for the insurer \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].  
* **Pricing & Reserving Implications:** The Basis for Cover has a direct impact on the data needed and the methods used for pricing and reserving. A losses-occurring policy requires the actuary to make a significant provision for IBNR, which is highly uncertain. A claims-made policy shifts this uncertainty, requiring less provision for pure IBNR but still needing careful analysis of IBNER \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP752.pdf\].
