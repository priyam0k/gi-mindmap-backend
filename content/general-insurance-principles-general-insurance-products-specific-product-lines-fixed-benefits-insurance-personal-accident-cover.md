As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a comprehensive note on **Personal Accident (PA) Cover**, positioning it within the broader context of **Fixed Benefits Insurance**. This product category is distinct from the more common indemnity-based products like property and liability insurance, a key conceptual point for the SP exams.

### **Specific Product Lines: Fixed Benefits Insurance**

#### **ðŸ”¸ Personal Accident (PA) Cover**

Fixed Benefits Insurance is one of the four main categories of general insurance, alongside liability, property damage, and financial loss. Its defining feature is that the policy pays a specified, fixed monetary amount upon the occurrence of a defined event, irrespective of the actual financial loss incurred by the policyholder. The principal example of this product line is Personal Accident (PA) insurance.

##### **1\. Customer Need and Benefits Provided**

The primary customer need for PA cover is to receive a cash sum to help cope with the financial and personal consequences of a serious accident. While it's impossible to perfectly quantify the financial value of losing a limb, for instance, a fixed benefit provides a pre-agreed level of compensation.

The policy is explicitly **not indemnity insurance**. The benefits provided are:

* Specified, fixed monetary amounts paid if the insured party suffers a defined injury (e.g., loss of a limb or an eye), permanent total disablement, or accidental death.  
* The benefit can also be a fixed amount paid per day, week, or month for periods of hospitalisation or disability, often after a defined waiting period.

PA cover is often included as a fixed benefit within other package policies. For example, a comprehensive motor insurance policy frequently includes fixed PA benefits for specified injuries arising from a motor accident. It can also be sold as a standalone product to individuals or on a group basis by an employer to its employees.

**Structure of Benefits:**

* **Unitised Cover:** Policyholders can often select their desired level of cover by purchasing a number of "units" of sum insured (e.g., a unit might represent Â£25,000 of cover).  
* **Continental Scale:** Policies frequently use a "continental scale," where lesser injuries receive a set proportion of the full sum insured for a major injury or death.

**Insurable Interest:**

* An individual is generally assumed to have an unlimited financial interest in their own life and well-being.  
* However, to mitigate moral hazard, insurers must be cautious not to grant excessively large sums insured for relatively minor injuries.

##### **2\. Insured Perils and Exclusions**

The central peril is any form of **accident** that results in a specified injury, permanent total disablement, or accidental death.

**Common Exclusions:** Policies typically exclude losses arising from:

* Dangerous pastimes (e.g., motor racing, pot-holing).  
* Suicide or self-inflicted injury.  
* Illegal activities by the policyholder.

##### **3\. Basis of Cover and Claim Characteristics**

* **Basis of Cover:** PA insurance is typically written on a **losses-occurring basis**, meaning it covers accidents that happen during the policy period, regardless of when the claim is reported.  
* **Tail Length:** This is generally a **short-tail** class of business. Claims are usually reported and settled quickly because the occurrence of an accident is typically a clear-cut event.  
* **Reporting and Settlement Delays:**  
  * An exception to the short tail is a claim for **permanent total disablement**. It may take several months or even years for the claimant's condition to stabilise enough for a final assessment to be made.  
  * For accidental death claims, there can be reporting delays if dependents are not immediately aware that the policy existed.  
* **Claim Frequency and Severity:**  
  * Claim frequency tends to be reasonably stable.  
  * The benefit amount is fixed and known in advance, but claims can be for large amounts, with cover of several hundred thousand pounds (or equivalent) per person not being uncommon.

##### **4\. Pricing: Exposure Measures and Rating Factors**

##### **ðŸ”¸ 4.1 Exposure Measure**

The most appropriate measure of exposure is the **person-year multiplied by the sum insured**.

However, for group or family policies where full details of every individual covered may not be available, a more practical measure like **member-year** or **employee-year** might be used instead. If a standard rate is used to cover a whole family, the insurer is exposed to selection risk, as the policy may be more attractive to larger families. For group schemes where benefits are linked to salaries, the **sum insured or total salaries** is often used.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 4.2 Risk and Rating Factors**

The premium is primarily determined by factors that influence the likelihood of an accident occurring.

* **Primary Factor:** The prime rating factor is **occupation**. Individuals in dangerous occupations (e.g., demolition work) present a much higher risk than those in safer, clerical roles.  
* **Other Key Factors:**  
  * **Sum Insured**: A direct driver of the potential claim cost.  
  * **Dangerous Pastimes**: Hobbies like motor racing increase risk and will be reflected in the premium.  
  * **Age**: Not usually a major factor until old age is reached, and cover is not normally sold to the elderly.  
  * **Health Condition**: The insured's state of health can be a determinant of risk.  
  * **Gender**: Historically a factor, as women tend to be less prone to accidents, but its use is now banned for rating purposes in the EU.

*Exam Coach Tip: In an exam question, Personal Accident is your go-to example for a **fixed benefits** product line. The most important point to make is that it is **not an indemnity contract**. You should contrast it with property and liability lines by highlighting this. Mentioning its generally short-tail nature, the specific exception for permanent total disablement claims, and the primary rating factor being **occupation** will demonstrate a solid, practical understanding. For higher-order marks, you could discuss the challenges of selecting an exposure measure for group policies (person-year vs. member-year) and the moral hazard risk associated with setting benefit levels for minor injuries.*
