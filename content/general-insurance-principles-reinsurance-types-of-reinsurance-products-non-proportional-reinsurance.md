As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8, let's construct a detailed, structured note on **Non-Proportional Reinsurance**. This is a critical topic within the broader syllabus area of "Types of Reinsurance Products" and is fundamental to understanding how insurers protect themselves against severe losses, a concept examined in SP7 (Reserving and Capital), SP8 (Pricing), and SA3 (Advanced Applications) \[11, 12, SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **Types of Reinsurance Products**

Traditional reinsurance products are divided into two fundamental categories based on how premiums and losses are shared between the ceding insurer (the cedant) and the reinsurer \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. These are:

1. **Proportional Reinsurance**: The cedant and reinsurer share premiums and losses in an agreed-upon proportion \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
2. **Non-Proportional Reinsurance**: The reinsurer's liability is triggered only when the cedant's loss exceeds a pre-agreed retention or "excess point."

This note will focus on the second category: Non-Proportional Reinsurance, also widely known as **Excess of Loss (XL)** reinsurance.

#### **ðŸ”¹ Non-Proportional Reinsurance (Excess of Loss \- XL)**

**Definition**: Under non-proportional reinsurance, the sharing of risk is not based on a fixed proportion \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The reinsurer agrees to indemnify the cedant for the amount of loss that exceeds a certain pre-agreed retention, often called an **"excess point"** or **"attachment point"**, up to a specified upper limit \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. Proportional reinsurance reduces the size of an insurer's net account, while non-proportional reinsurance caps the cost of very large claims \[SP7.pdf\].

* **Mechanism**: The insurer pays a fixed premium for this cover, which is not directly proportional to the original premiums written \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. In return, the reinsurer pays for the portion of a loss that falls within a defined layer of cover \[SP7.pdf\].  
* **Purpose**: This type of cover is crucial for protecting an insurer against volatility from large, severe, or catastrophic loss events that could otherwise threaten its solvency \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Commission**: Unlike proportional reinsurance, ceding commissions (return and override) are not normally relevant to XL reinsurance, as the reinsurer charges a specific premium for the cover \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. However, profit commission is a possibility for some lower, more frequently hit layers, known as "working layers" \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

There are several distinct types of XL reinsurance, each designed to protect against different types of loss accumulations.

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.1 Risk Excess of Loss (Risk XL)**

**Definition**: This form of XL reinsurance protects an insurer against large **individual losses** \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. The reinsurance responds if a single claim, arising from a single risk, exceeds the retention \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

* **Purpose**: It is a vital tool for managing volatility in **liability classes** (e.g., employers' liability, motor third party liability), where individual claims can be extremely large and threaten an insurer's solvency \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
* **Example**: A treaty of "Â£4.5m excess of Â£0.5m" means the insurer pays the first Â£0.5m of any single claim. The reinsurer pays the amount of the claim above Â£0.5m, up to a maximum recovery of Â£4.5m. The insurer remains liable for any part of the claim exceeding Â£5m (Â£0.5m retention \+ Â£4.5m layer) \[SP7.pdf\].

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.2 Catastrophe Excess of Loss (Catastrophe XL)**

**Definition**: This protects an insurer against an accumulation of many smaller claims arising from a **single catastrophic event**, such as a hurricane, earthquake, or flood \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. The retention and limit apply to the total aggregated loss from that one event \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\].

* **Mechanism**: A critical feature of a Catastrophe XL treaty is the **"hours clause"**, which defines the limited time period (e.g., 72 consecutive hours for a windstorm) during which all individual losses from a single event can be aggregated and treated as one claim for the purpose of the reinsurance recovery \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\]. The cedant can choose the starting point of this period to maximise its recovery \[SP7.pdf\].  
* **Purpose**: To protect the insurer from the severe financial impact of a single, widespread disaster that affects a large number of its policyholders simultaneously \[SP7.pdf\].

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.3 Aggregate Excess of Loss (Aggregate XL)**

**Definition**: This is a broader form where the retention and limit apply to the cumulative amount of all losses during a defined period (typically one year), rather than losses from a single risk or event \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. The cover could apply to all losses or be restricted to losses from a specific peril or cause \[Reinsurance.pdf\]. The contract may have an interior deductible, meaning it only applies to individual losses greater than a stated amount \[SP7.pdf\].

##### **ðŸ”¸ 2.4 Stop Loss Reinsurance**

**Definition**: This is the widest form of aggregate XL and provides protection based on a company's total claims over a period, often expressed as a **loss ratio** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\].

* **Mechanism**: The retention and limit are often expressed as a percentage of the cedantâ€™s premium income. For example, a treaty might cover losses for the portion of the loss ratio in the layer between 110% and 140% \[SP7.pdf, SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf\].  
* **Purpose**: Its primary purpose is to directly protect an insurer's overall underwriting result for a specific class or its entire account. It is a tool for **smoothing profits** and providing stability to the insurer's financial results \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
* **Disadvantages**: This cover can be expensive. Reinsurers are often cautious due to the **moral hazard** involvedâ€”if the insurer's bottom line is protected, it may have less incentive to underwrite prudently or control its claims costs \[SP8.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].

#### **Exam Coach Tip:**

When answering questions on reinsurance products, it is crucial to distinguish clearly between Proportional and Non-Proportional methods.

* **Core Principle**: For **Non-Proportional**, the key concept is the **layer of cover**, defined by a retention (or attachment point) and a limit. The reinsurer's involvement is triggered only when a loss (whether from a single risk, a single event, or an annual aggregation) breaches that retention \[SP7.pdf\].  
* **Application Scenarios**: Be ready to recommend a specific XL product for a given scenario.  
  * An insurer writing UK Motor Third Party Liability **must** have **Risk XL** to protect against huge individual bodily injury claims \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
  * A property insurer with a high concentration of policies in a flood-prone area needs **Catastrophe XL** \[SP7.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\].  
  * An insurer wanting to protect its overall annual result from an unexpectedly high frequency of attritional claims would seek **Stop Loss** cover \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].  
* **Key Clauses**: For higher-order marks, mention specific treaty clauses relevant to XL cover, such as the **stability/indexation clause** (protecting the reinsurer from inflation eroding the real value of the retention) and **reinstatement provisions** (restoring cover after a claim, often for an additional premium) \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP8 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, Reinsurance.pdf\]. This demonstrates a deeper, SP8-level understanding of how these contracts operate in practice.
