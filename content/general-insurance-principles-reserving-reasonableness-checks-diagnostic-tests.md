Welcome, aspiring SP7 actuaries\! It's absolutely critical that you, as future specialist actuaries, master the art of reasonableness checks, with a keen focus on diagnostic tests. In the complex world of General Insurance Reserving and Capital Modelling, a single best estimate is rarely sufficient, and understanding the nuances of your results is paramount for effective communication and sound decision-making \[16.352, 18.0\].

Now, let's break down this crucial concept, step-by-step, as you would approach it in your professional practice and, indeed, in your exam.

### **1\. The Crucial Role of Reasonableness Checks in Reserving**

First and foremost, after calculating reserves, whether using traditional triangulation methods or more advanced stochastic models, it is **imperative** that the actuary checks the reasonableness of the outcome \[17.0, 16.8.6\]. This isn't just a formality; it's a fundamental part of ensuring the figures are justifiable and that the adopted methodology and assumptions are appropriate \[17.0\].

Think of it as the feedback loop in the actuarial control cycle: you notice deviations, understand the reasons, and then make appropriate adjustments \[17.392\]. This involves a delicate balance between gaining additional understanding from analyses and managing the cost and time involved \[17.385\]. Ultimately, the final selection of results relies on a blend of analysis and seasoned professional judgement \[17.385, 17.386\]. Your experience acts as an implicit benchmark, guiding your view on what constitutes a "reasonable" range for diagnostics \[17.386\]. However, always be mindful that your experience might be limited or not typical, necessitating peer review or seeking help from more experienced actuaries \[17.386, 17.387\].

### **2\. Diagnostic Tests: Your Actuarial Radar**

**2.1 What is a Diagnostic?** A diagnostic, in the context of reserving, is essentially a measure used to assist with the interpretation of data or results \[17.2.1\]. It acts as a tool to test and verify the underlying methodology and assumptions, indicating when experience might be inconsistent with your initial assumptions \[17.2.1\]. Diagnostics can test results (e.g., IBNR divided by premium), data (e.g., paid claims divided by incurred claims), or even both (e.g., ultimate loss ratios) \[17.2.1\]. They provide a high-level "reasonableness" check and help pinpoint areas of the portfolio that require closer examination \[17.388\].

**2.2 Purpose and Importance of Diagnostics** The primary purpose of diagnostics is to ensure that the chosen results are reasonable and that they are supported by emerging experience \[17.418, 17.383\]. For instance, actuaries frequently perform an 'Actual versus Expected' exercise, comparing observed experience against projections from the last review to inform assumption updates \[17.383\]. Diagnostics help to:

* **Identify inconsistencies:** Highlight deviations from expected patterns or assumptions \[17.2.1\].  
* **Guide investigations:** Direct the actuary to investigate reasons for unusual features \[17.389\].  
* **Inform adjustments:** Determine whether changes to methodology or assumptions are necessary \[17.389, 17.391\].  
* **Provide transparency:** Support communication to stakeholders by offering clear insights into the reserving process \[17.392\].  
* **Refine models:** Especially useful for assessing the reasonableness and validity of stochastic reserving results before communication \[16.8.6, 16.365\].

### **3\. Key Diagnostic Tests and Their Insights**

Let's delve into the specifics of typical diagnostics you'll use in a reserving exercise, considering their application and the insights they provide.

**3.1 Loss Ratios** Monitoring changes in various loss ratios (paid, outstanding, IBNR, incurred, and ultimate) can highlight critical trends. For example, changes in premium rating strength might be revealed \[17.394\]. Adjusting underlying premiums for rate movements (using a rate index) can help isolate this effect, but beware of rating increases genuinely reflecting increased risk \[17.394, 17.410\]. Ultimate loss ratios, in particular, can signal shifts in claims underwriting stringency, improvements or worsening of claims experience, or changes in the rating basis \[17.388\].

**3.2 Paid to Incurred and/or Case Estimates to Incurred Ratios** These diagnostics are excellent indicators of the strength of case estimates \[17.395\]. An increasing ratio of paid claims to incurred claims over time in a cumulative triangle might suggest that the strength of case estimates has decreased. Conversely, if the ratio of case estimates to incurred claims rises, it could indicate an increase in case estimate strength \[17.395\]. Understanding the business reasons behind these changes is crucial to determine if adjustments to data subdivision or approach are needed \[17.396\].

**3.3 Average Outstanding Case Estimate** A review of the average outstanding case estimate triangle can directly highlight changes in the prudence or strength of case reserves over time \[17.396\].

**3.4 Ratio of IBNR to Case Estimates** For more mature cohorts, where IBNR is predominantly due to IBNER (Incurred But Not Enough Reported) rather than "pure" IBNR claims, this diagnostic offers a valuable perspective on the outstanding claims and their associated uncertainty \[17.396, 17.397\].

**3.5 Survival Ratios** Survival ratios demonstrate how long a reserve or IBNR estimate is expected to last, assuming current paid or incurred claims development rates continue \[17.397, 17.419\]. These are particularly useful for very long-tailed classes like those with asbestos losses. For instance, the three-year survival ratio (loss reserves to three-year paid loss average) indicates how many years the reserves should last if average paid losses remain constant with no additional reserving \[17.397, 17.398\]. Comparisons can be made against similar portfolios or market benchmarks \[17.397\].

**3.6 Claim Frequency and Average Cost per Claim Diagnostics** Where claim count information is available, these diagnostics are invaluable. Changes in frequency and severity can highlight inflationary trends in claims costs and shifts in claim frequency per unit of exposure \[17.398\]. Monitoring open nil claim counts (claims reported but no payment made yet) can provide an early warning of anticipated increases in claim costs or processing issues \[17.399\].

**3.7 Reinsurance to Gross Ratios** Applying all the above diagnostics both gross and net of reinsurance is essential \[17.399\]. Furthermore, examining the ratios between gross, reinsurance, and net estimates is valuable. Ideally, if reinsurance programs and claims experience are consistent across origin years, these ratios should remain uniform. However, changes are common and require understanding, especially the impact of fixed limits and deductibles that may reduce with inflation \[17.399, 17.400\]. Changes can stem from shifts in business retention, mix of reinsurance cover (proportional vs. non-proportional), policy terms, underlying gross experience, or inconsistencies in treating gross and net estimates \[17.400\].

**3.8 Incremental Development Triangles** A more recent addition to the diagnostic toolkit for assessing reasonableness is the use of incremental development triangles. These diagnostics compare the level of IBNR or reserves for a given cohort to movements observed in prior cohorts as they developed to ultimate. While not a precise technique, they offer a valuable "sense check" on selections, particularly when significant judgement has been used or when viewed at a less granular level than the initial reserve calculations.

**3.9 Development Pattern Diagnostics** This is one of the most important sets of diagnostics \[17.401\]. It involves comparing assumed future development patterns with historical ones, typically by examining cumulative (paid or incurred) claims development as a proportion of the estimated ultimate claims for a given origin cohort \[17.401\].

* **Calendar-Year Distortions:** You can identify these by looking for diagonals in your run-off triangle that show a consistent bias towards 'high' or 'low' development factors (e.g., using a median development factor analysis) \[17.402\].  
* **Stability of Development Pattern:** Where the pattern is volatile, the reliability of estimates should be questioned \[17.403\]. Given that adverse development often outweighs favorable development, the distribution of final outcomes is typically positively skewed, requiring consideration of a sufficient "tail" beyond historical experience \[17.403\].  
* **Comparison to Benchmarks:** Utilise industry, market, or closely related internal classes as benchmarks for development patterns. Similar portfolios from your own actuarial experience can also provide valuable comparison points \[17.405, 17.420\].  
* **Residuals of Fitted Link Ratios:** Analyzing the size and pattern of residuals from individually fitted link ratios can provide useful insights. Widely-spread or skewed residual patterns may indicate high uncertainty or inappropriateness of the estimated link ratio. Consistent patterns, such as a diagonal showing consistently high residuals, can pinpoint underlying data distortions like a calendar year effect (e.g., internal initiatives to speed up claim settlement) \[17.406\].

### **4\. Interpreting and Responding to Diagnostics**

Once diagnostics highlight unusual features, an actuary's crucial next steps involve:

1. **Investigation:** Understand the underlying reasons for the unusual feature \[17.389\]. This often requires qualitative information from claims and underwriting teams \[17.242, 17.414\].  
2. **Implications:** Assess the implications for the reserving process \[17.389\].  
3. **Action:** Take appropriate action, which could involve changing methodology or assumptions, if necessary \[17.389\].

**4.1 Materiality and Professional Judgement** It's vital to consider **materiality** when addressing features revealed by diagnostics \[17.391\]. If a change in reserves resulting from an unusual feature is immaterial relative to the company's total reserves, an actuary *may* decide not to update their methodology or assumptions, depending on the purpose of the reserving exercise \[17.391\]. Remember, your professional judgement is paramount, and you must carefully balance relying on past experience against overreacting to new trends \[17.409\]. Periodically reviewing the accuracy of previous estimates is a good practice to learn which methods work well in different situations \[17.409\].

**4.2 Underwriting Cycle and Reserving Cycle** When assessing reasonableness, you must consider the **underwriting cycle** \[17.410\]. For instance, a rate index can be used in credibility-type methods to account for the underwriting cycle when deriving initial expected loss ratios \[17.410\]. It's also important to be aware of the "reserving cycle" – the phenomenon where reported reserves tend to be conservative during hard market periods and less so during soft markets \[17.411\]. This affects development patterns, as longer patterns are typical in a soft market \[17.421\]. While management might aim to flatten this cycle for more accurate profitability understanding, the actuary's best estimate should remain objective, though they may indicate a range of "best estimates" \[17.411\].

### **5\. Integration and Communication**

Diagnostics are not isolated tools. They complement other methods for quantifying uncertainty, such as stochastic models, scenario tests, and the use of alternative sets of assumptions \[16.8.6, 16.366, 18.3\]. For example, stress and scenario tests can be used to validate the output from a stochastic model, providing additional context and challenge \[20.2.5, 20.4.7\].

Finally, the results of diagnostic analyses, along with all key assumptions, limitations, and areas of uncertainty, must be communicated clearly and effectively to all interested parties—be they senior management, the board of directors, or regulators \[13.2.1, 13.2.2, 18.442, 18.443, 20.498\]. Ensure consistent vocabulary and a focus on the most significant issues, tailored to the recipient's likely use of the information \[18.451, 18.442\].

By diligently applying these diagnostic tests and exercising sound professional judgement, you will not only build robust actuarial opinions but also enhance your ability to navigate the complexities of general insurance reserving and capital modelling. Keep practicing, and you'll master this crucial skill for SP7 and beyond\!
