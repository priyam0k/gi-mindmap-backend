## **Purpose of Reserves: Information for Management**

### **1\. The Core Purpose of Management Accounts**

The primary objective of internal management accounts, and therefore the reserving exercise that feeds into them, is to **support the effective management and strategic direction of the general insurance company**. Unlike statutory or published accounts, which cater to external stakeholders like regulators or shareholders, management accounts are tailored to provide internal decision-makers with detailed, timely, and relevant financial insights.

Specifically, these accounts aim to help management:

* **Determine profitability for each class of business**. This granular view is essential for understanding where the company is truly making or losing money.  
* **Identify the need for rating revisions and assist in carrying them out**. By understanding profitability at a detailed level, management can make informed decisions about adjusting premium rates.  
* **Project the companyâ€™s financial position**, including profit testing. This forward-looking perspective is vital for business planning and strategic decision-making.  
* **Analyse and project claims and exposure**. This involves a deep dive into the underlying experience to spot trends and potential issues early.

### **2\. Characteristics of the Reserving Basis for Management Accounts**

When determining reserves for internal management accounts, actuaries typically adopt a specific approach:

* **Best Estimate Basis:** The general aim is to produce **expected values of future experience based on realistic assumptions**. The goal here is a true and fair representation of the financial state, unburdened by excessive prudence or optimism that might be present in other reporting bases. This means removing any explicit margins on outstanding claims.  
* **Granularity:** Management accounts often require results at a **more detailed level** than external reports. This allows for a breakdown into smaller groups, such as specific products, schemes, distribution channels, or even individual brokers, to inform targeted decisions. However, actuaries must balance the desire for fine granularity with the need for sufficient data homogeneity and credibility, avoiding overly mechanical approaches that compromise analysis quality.  
* **Frequency:** These reports are typically prepared **more regularly** than annual statutory returns, often on a monthly or quarterly basis, to provide up-to-date insights. This facilitates timely monitoring and adjustments.  
* **Future Cashflows:** There's an increasing demand for actuaries to produce **cashflows of future payments** (premiums, claims, expenses) for internal use, beyond just point estimates of reserves. These cashflows are crucial for:  
  * Discounting of reserves, premium, and expense provisions.  
  * Input into asset and liability matching (ALM) strategies.  
  * Estimating the impact of claims inflation on reserves. Under IFRS 17, for instance, these cashflows directly influence declared profit via discounting and the unwinding of discount on emerging experience, necessitating rigorous review similar to other reserving assumptions.  
* **Contingency Reserves:** Management accounts may explicitly include **contingency reserves** that might not be appropriate for statutory accounts but are useful for internal reporting purposes.

### **3\. Key Analyses and Information for Management**

Management requires various analyses to effectively steer the company:

* **Sensitivity Testing and Scenario Analysis:** While a best estimate basis is used, management will undoubtedly be interested in **what could go wrong**. This involves carrying out sensitivity testing to understand the impact of changes to key assumptions, such as:  
  * Changes in volume and mix of business.  
  * Changes in claim frequency and claim size.  
  * Changes in claims inflation.  
  * Changes in expenses and expense inflation. Scenario tests allow the exploration of plausible adverse events (e.g., emergence of latent claims, reinsurer defaults, or significant court judgment changes) and their impact on outstanding liabilities and company resilience.  
* **Impact of Market Values on Solvency:** Management is concerned with major fluctuations in immediate market values and their impact on solvency calculations, as well as the perceptions of regulators and rating agencies.  
* **Prospective Results:** Management often requires prospective results on various bases, including Companies Act and statutory returns, to understand potential future reporting outcomes.  
* **Trends and Performance:** Identifying trends in claims at an early stage, such as a decline in performance of certain contracts, is critical for timely intervention and strategic adjustments. This also extends to analysing and projecting capital requirements.

### **4\. Interdepartmental Collaboration and Communication**

Effective information for management is a collaborative effort:

* **Discussion with Management:** Assumptions and methodologies must be discussed and agreed upon with management. It's crucial that they understand the underlying rationale and limitations of the analyses.  
* **Interaction with Claims Department:** Regular discussions with the claims department are paramount. Actuaries must be aware of:  
  * Key uncertainties in the data.  
  * Information known to the claims team not yet reflected in data, such as claims on a "watchlist" due to significant uncertainty (e.g., D\&O claims where formal claims haven't been made but notification exists).  
  * The potential for unusual claims compared to historical experience, or changes in monitoring approaches.  
  * The circumstances of particularly uncertain claims (e.g., nil vs. policy limit settlements) to inform scenario development. Information sharing should be bidirectional, with actuaries sharing aggregated trends they observe to help the claims team focus efforts, and the claims team explaining reasons for these trends. The actuary should assess the materiality of watchlist losses and whether IBNR is sufficient, rather than simply adding them to projected IBNR.  
* **Underwriting Teams:** Sharing reserving observations with underwriting teams facilitates discussion and allows for easier analysis of the impact of changes in portfolio mix. It also helps underwriters appreciate the gearing of returns on capital and the significance of pricing terms and conditions.  
* **Auditors:** While management may choose to book reserves more conservatively than the actuary's best estimate, auditors are alert to the potential for smoothing of results through changes in reserve margins. This underscores the need for clear communication and justification of reserving bases.  
* **Regulators and Rating Agencies:** Management needs to consider the impact of market movements on solvency calculations and how these affect perceptions by regulators and rating agencies. Convincing senior management of the benefits of return on capital considerations as a way of enhancing business performance, rather than merely satisfying regulatory requirements, is also vital.

### **5\. Professional Issues and Communication of Uncertainty**

Given that reserving is not an exact science, and different actuaries might arrive at different best estimates for the same data and purpose due to inherent judgment:

* **Defining "Best Estimate":** Actuaries must clearly define what they mean by a "best estimate" reserve, typically the expected value of outstanding liabilities, after accounting for model, parameter, and process uncertainty. Under Solvency II, it means the mean of all possible outcomes.  
* **Quantifying Uncertainty:** It is often no longer sufficient to describe reserves using single point estimates without gauging the size of prediction errors. Stochastic reserving methods provide confidence intervals and distributions of possible outcomes, which can be used to:  
  * Assess reserve adequacy and strength.  
  * Quantify reserving risk for capital models.  
  * Inform management and the Board for ongoing decision-making (e.g., business expansion/contraction).  
  * Provide information to investors and regulators.  
* **Communicating Uncertainty and Limitations:** Communicating the outputs of a stochastic reserving exercise, along with its limitations, assumptions, and materiality of judgments, is paramount. This includes explaining:  
  * Which elements of reserves are included (e.g., allocated/unallocated loss adjustment expenses, net/gross of reinsurance/salvage).  
  * The extent to which a margin or range reflects various sources of uncertainty (specification, selection, estimation, and process error).  
  * Using simple measures like graphs of outcome distributions and tables of key percentiles.  
  * Clarifying the type of range being communicated (e.g., range of best estimates, range of possible outcomes, range of reasonable/plausible outcomes).  
* **Reconciling Different Views:** When alternative estimates arise (e.g., from another actuary or management), it is important to compare results and diagnostics to identify differences and communicate these to stakeholders. Factors to consider in resolving differences include overall materiality, the purpose of the exercise, validity of alternative estimates, seeking peer review, and the overall financial strength of the insurer. Actuaries must be mindful of potential pressure to reduce figures if a financial interest exists.

In essence, providing "Information for Management" regarding reserves is a dynamic and multifaceted role for the general insurance actuary, requiring not only technical proficiency but also strong communication skills and a deep understanding of the business context.
