As a Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach for SP8: General Insurance Pricing Specialist Principles, the UK scheme **Flood Re** is a highly relevant case study demonstrating how systemic **Climate and Environmental Factors** necessitate specific market interventions to manage risk accumulation and maintain public insurability.

Flood Re functions as a crucial mechanism established in the UK to address the political and financial challenges posed by high flood risk properties in the context of increasing climate volatility.

## **I. Climate Risk and the Necessity of Market Intervention**

Climate and environmental factors introduce major uncertainties, particularly through changes in weather patterns and catastrophic event frequency. Rising sea levels and increased flood risk, expected consequences of global warming, severely impact the long-term **insurability** of certain regions.

1. **Insurability and Political Risk:** If properties in specific areas become substantially more vulnerable to loss, their owners may struggle to find insurance cover, which leads directly to **political issues**.  
2. **Moral Obligation:** Governments often feel a **moral obligation to protect householders** from flooding. This obligation is sometimes met through state-funded flood defences (like the Thames barrier in London) or through nationally-administered schemes or pooling arrangements, as seen in France and the United States.  
3. **UK Concern:** In the UK, a key concern emerged that individuals, particularly those on low incomes living in low-lying or coastal properties, might be **unable to afford home insurance** due to prohibitively expensive premiums reflecting the high risk.

## **II. Establishment and Purpose of Flood Re**

In response to this specific market failure concerning affordability and access to cover, the UK government and the insurance industry collaboratively set up a fund called **Flood Re**.

The core purpose of the scheme is to **provide affordable flood insurance to high-risk policyholders**. Flood Re was introduced in April 2016, and by April 2017, 60 insurance providers had signed up to the scheme.

## **III. Operational Mechanics as a Pooling Arrangement**

Flood Re functions as a pooling arrangement designed to redistribute the high cost of flood risk across the general home insurance market.

1. **Risk Transfer:** The policyholder purchases home insurance from a standard insurer as normal. The insurer then transfers the **flood risk element** of that home insurance policy to Flood Re.  
2. **Premium Determination:** In return for accepting this risk element, the insurer pays Flood Re a premium based on the property’s **Council tax band**. This ensures that the cost of flood coverage for high-risk properties is capped at an affordable, politically acceptable level.  
3. **Funding Mechanism (The Levy):** Flood Re is financially supported by a **levy placed on all insurers**. This levy is proportional to each insurer’s share of the total home insurance market. This structure ensures that the financial burden of high-risk flood claims is mutualized across the entire UK home insurance sector.
