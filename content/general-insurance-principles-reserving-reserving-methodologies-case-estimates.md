### **1\. Reserving Methodologies: Setting the Scene**

At its heart, reserving is about quantifying an insurer's financial obligations for claims \[SP7.pdf, pg 126, 637\]. These liabilities arise from events that have already occurred, whether reported or not, and from future cover on policies for which premiums have already been received \[SP7.pdf, pg 127, 627\]. To achieve this, actuaries employ various methodologies and make critical assumptions, depending on the purpose of the valuation \[SP7.pdf, pg 239, 240, 241, 265, 266; SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 59\].

One of the two primary approaches to estimating outstanding claims involves making estimates for **each individual outstanding claim**, known as 'case estimates' or 'case by case estimation' \[SP7.pdf, pg 128, 628; SP8.pdf, pg 128, 628\]. This stands in contrast to 'statistical techniques', which estimate total outstanding payments for an entire portfolio \[SP7.pdf, pg 128, 628; SP8.pdf, pg 128, 628\]. In practice, general insurers typically use a combination of both \[SP7.pdf, pg 129, 629; SP8.pdf, pg 129, 629\].

### **2\. What Exactly Are Case Estimates?**

A **case estimate** is the insurer's best individual assessment of the likely cost of a claim once it has been notified. It is a specific amount set aside for a particular, known claim.

* **Definition**: It is an estimate of the liability for *each individual outstanding claim* \[SP7.pdf, pg 128, 628; SP8.pdf, pg 128, 628\].  
* **Focus**: Case estimates are specifically for *reported claims* (claims of which the insurer is already aware). They *cannot* be used for **IBNR** (Incurred But Not Reported) claims, as these claims are, by definition, unknown to the insurer at the valuation date \[SP7.pdf, pg 129, 292, 373, 629; SP8.pdf, pg 129, 629\]. Separate methods are required to estimate IBNR \[SP7.pdf, pg 292, 373\].  
* **Dynamic Nature**: An initial estimate is typically placed on a claim file when it is first notified. This estimate can be updated periodically or whenever a payment is made, reflecting the latest known facts of the case \[SP7.pdf, pg 183, 677; SP8.pdf, pg 183, 677\].  
* **Standard Reserves**: For non-large claims, insurers may use a "standard reserve" amount until the claim is settled \[SP7.pdf, pg 184, 678; SP8.pdf, pg 184, 678\].

### **3\. Purpose and Use of Case Estimates**

Case estimates serve various critical functions within an insurer's operations and financial reporting:

* **Individual Claim Assessment**: They are the direct quantification of liability for specific claims, especially large or complex ones \[SP7.pdf, pg 292\]. For instance, a D\&O claim with significant uncertainty may be placed on a "claims watchlist" where its case reserve might not fully capture the likely cost \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 52\].  
* **Less Suitable for Volume Business**: For classes with many small, stable claims (e.g., private motor), statistical techniques are generally more efficient and appropriate than individual case estimation \[SP7.pdf, pg 129, 629; SP8.pdf, pg 129, 629\].  
* **Input to Financial Reporting**: Case estimates feed into the overall "outstanding claims reserves" shown in financial accounts and solvency reports \[SP7.pdf, pg 126, 127, 240, 626, 627\].  
* **Assessment of Adequacy**: They are vital for assessing the accuracy of prior year-end estimates by comparing actual payments and movements against initial case estimates \[SP7.pdf, pg 212, 60; SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 60\].  
* **London Market Practice**: In the London Market, where policies are often co-insured, the lead insurer typically handles the claim and advises reserves to other participating insurers (followers). It's common for followers to adopt the leader's advised reserve, though some may adjust it for contentious claims \[SP7.pdf, pg 186, 680; SP8.pdf, pg 186, 680\].  
* **Large Claims Management**: Specialist loss adjusters often manage large claims and advise insurers on the expected ultimate cost, with many insurers adopting these advised reserves \[SP7.pdf, pg 186, 680; SP8.pdf, pg 186, 680\]. Claims under close monitoring or "watchlists" require careful attention, as their case reserves might not represent the final outcome due to uncertainty, legal considerations, or differing views among co-insurers \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 52-53\]. Actuaries need to assess if projected IBNR is sufficient to cover such claims \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 54\].

### **4\. Factors Influencing the Setting and Accuracy of Case Estimates**

The reliability and magnitude of case estimates are subject to a multitude of factors, both internal to the insurer and external:

* **Case Estimate Philosophy**: Each company has its own philosophy and guidelines for claims assessors. Some aim for "realistic" estimates, while others prefer an element of "prudence" \[SP7.pdf, pg 185, 679; SP8.pdf, pg 185, 679\].  
  * **Impact on Development**: If case estimates are consistently *under-reserved* (prudent), it can lead to positive development (reserves increasing as claims mature) \[SP7.pdf, pg 282\]. Conversely, if they are *over-reserved* (optimistic), negative development may occur \[SP7.pdf, pg 282\].  
* **Assessor Skill and Judgement**: The quality of case estimates heavily relies on the skill and judgement of the individual assessors. Different individuals may produce differing results due to subjective interpretation \[SP7.pdf, pg 293\].  
* **Bias**: Assessors might naturally be conservative or optimistic. Additionally, when estimates are used for negotiation with claimants, there can be a tendency for the estimate to be biased towards the lower end \[SP7.pdf, pg 293\].  
* **Consistency**: It is challenging to ensure consistency in applying inflation rates or generating estimates across a range of possible bases using individual case estimates \[SP7.pdf, pg 294\].  
* **Changes in Reserving Philosophy/Procedures**: A change in the company's reserving philosophy (e.g., from prudent to realistic) or claims handling procedures (e.g., speeding up or slowing down payments) can significantly distort historical run-off patterns when based on reported claims \[SP7.pdf, pg 191, 316, 685; SP8 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 600, 601; SP7.pdf, pg 475\]. Such changes need to be accounted for in actuarial analysis \[SP7.pdf, pg 475\].  
* **External Environment**:  
  * **Legal Environment**: For classes like Employment Practices Liability (EPL), the current legal environment and the industry covered significantly impact claim costs \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 38, 594\].  
  * **Judicial Decisions**: Court judgments can profoundly affect an insurer's liability for claims, setting precedents, applying retrospectively, and driving "social inflation" (court award inflation) which increases claim costs \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 50, 598; SP8.pdf, pg 665\]. This can exacerbate uncertainty, especially for latent claims \[SP7.pdf, pg 178\].

### **5\. Data Requirements for Case Estimates**

While statistical methods often demand data structured in specific ways (like run-off triangles) and grouped homogeneously, case estimates have their own data needs to facilitate individual claim assessment:

* **Core Data Items**: Key data points for each claim include dates of reporting and occurrence, paid amounts, historical case estimates, and associated premium information \[SP7.pdf, pg 193, 195, 6.2, 6.4\].  
* **Additional Measures**: Information on the number of claims, other exposure measures (e.g., turnover, payroll, vehicle-years), and expenses are also sometimes required \[SP7.pdf, pg 194, 199, 6.2, 6.8\]. Direct claims settlement expenses are typically included within paid claims and case estimates, but this should always be confirmed with claims staff \[SP7.pdf, pg 199\].  
* **Recoveries**: Whether the data is gross or net of recoveries (salvage, subrogation, reinsurance) is crucial, as recoveries can significantly impact the net liability \[SP7.pdf, pg 196, 355, 356, 6.4, 8.1, 8.2\]. Recoveries should ideally be projected separately from gross amounts due to different payment patterns \[SP7.pdf, pg 356\].  
* **Level of Granularity**: Case estimates can be gathered and used at a class level or a more aggregated level, depending on the reserving methodology and purpose \[SP7.pdf, pg 196, 6.4\].

### **6\. Challenges, Errors, and Limitations of Case Estimates**

Despite their utility, case estimates are far from perfect and come with inherent challenges:

* **Inability to Estimate IBNR**: As mentioned, this is a fundamental limitation. Case estimates can only be set for claims that are *known* to the insurer \[SP7.pdf, pg 129, 292, 373, 629; SP8.pdf, pg 129, 629\].  
* **Subjectivity and Variability**: The reliance on individual skill and judgement means different assessors may produce varied results. This subjectivity makes it difficult to ensure consistency across a large portfolio or over time \[SP7.pdf, pg 293\].  
* **Difficulty in Validation**: Case estimates are "extremely difficult to check" or audit independently \[SP7.pdf, pg 293\].  
* **Time and Resource Intensive**: For classes with thousands of outstanding claims, individual case estimation can be highly time-consuming and costly \[SP7.pdf, pg 293\].  
* **Inconsistent Inflation Allowance**: Individual assessors might not apply consistent inflation rates to their estimates, making aggregate inflation analysis difficult \[SP7.pdf, pg 294\].  
* **Limited Scenario Analysis**: It's challenging to produce estimates on a range of possible bases (e.g., optimistic, best estimate, pessimistic) using individual case estimates alone \[SP7.pdf, pg 294\].  
* **External Access Limitations**: External parties, such as auditors or consultants, often do not have access to sufficient granular data to perform their own detailed case-by-case estimates \[SP7.pdf, pg 294\].  
* **Data Distortion**: Changes in case reserving philosophy or inconsistent updates to estimates can distort historical run-off patterns used by statistical methods \[SP7.pdf, pg 191, 685; SP8.pdf, pg 685\].  
* **"Claims Watchlists" and Uncertainty**: For claims under close monitoring (watchlists), case reserves may not be truly representative of the likely outcome due to significant uncertainty (e.g., legal outcomes, differences in opinion among co-insurers) \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 52-53\]. Actuaries must consider if the IBNR projected by statistical methods is sufficient to cover the emergence of these potentially large losses \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 54\].  
* **Prudence and Financial Reporting**: While case estimates might aim for a "realistic" view, reserves booked for published accounts are often higher than the best estimate due to a desire for conservatism, smoothing of results, regulatory requirements, or auditor influence \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 49; SP7.pdf, pg 170\]. This means the "case estimate" used internally may already contain a margin that needs to be understood when comparing it to a pure "best estimate" \[SP7.pdf, pg 170\].

### **7\. Relationship with Other Reserving Methods**

Case estimates are not standalone. They are deeply integrated with and complement other reserving methodologies:

* **Hybrid Approach**: As noted, insurers combine case estimates with statistical techniques. Statistical methods (like Chain Ladder, Bornhuetter-Ferguson, Average Cost Per Claim) are more suited for high-frequency, stable claims, while case estimates are critical for low-frequency, high-severity, complex claims \[SP7.pdf, pg 129, 629; SP8.pdf, pg 129, 629\].  
* **Input for Triangulations**: Case estimates form a fundamental component of "incurred claims" data used in triangulation methods (e.g., incurred \= paid claims \+ case estimates for outstanding reported claims) \[SP7.pdf, pg 281, 339\]. Changes in case reserving procedures directly influence the incurred claims development observed in triangles \[SP7.pdf, pg 316\].  
* **ACPC Method**: The Average Cost Per Claim (ACPC) method often uses incurred claims data, which includes case estimates, and calculates an average cost per claim based on these amounts \[SP7.pdf, pg 339\].  
* **Diagnostics**: Various diagnostic ratios assess the reasonableness of reserving results. For instance, the "Paid to Incurred" ratio or "Case Estimates to Incurred" ratio can indicate the strength and changes in case estimate adequacy over time \[SP7.pdf, pg 462\]. The ratio of IBNR to case estimates is particularly useful for more mature cohorts, where IBNR is largely IBNER (Incurred But Not Enough Reported) rather than pure IBNR \[SP7.pdf, pg 463\].  
* **Pricing Inputs**: Case estimates, as part of the total claims data, are essential for determining the pure risk premium in pricing \[SP8.pdf, pg 710\]. For pricing purposes, it's crucial that case estimates represent a "best estimate" to avoid building implicit margins into premiums \[SP8.pdf, pg 811\].  
* **Run-off versus Case Estimate Models**: For some changes in claims handling procedures that affect only the development of incurred claims, actuaries might rely more heavily on paid development data for projections, rather than incurred data, which is influenced by case estimates \[SP7.pdf, pg 307\].

### **8\. The Role of Actuarial Judgement and Communication**

The inherent uncertainties and complexities associated with case estimates highlight the critical role of actuarial judgement and clear communication:

* **Actuarial Judgement**: When using any reserving method, including reliance on case estimates, actuaries must apply significant judgement. This includes assessing the impact of re-underwriting, unusual claims (like those on watchlists), and external factors, ensuring they are adequately reflected in the reserves \[SP7.pdf, pg 310, 475; SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 54\].  
* **Communication of Basis**: The entire reserving basis, including how case estimates are used and defined (e.g., gross or net of reinsurance/salvage/subrogation, inclusion of allocated/unallocated loss adjustment expenses), must be communicated clearly to enable stakeholders to understand the rationale and reasonableness of assumptions \[SP7.pdf, pg 263, 267\].  
* **Uncertainty Disclosure**: Actuaries must communicate the uncertainties surrounding best estimates. Discussions with claims teams are invaluable for explaining key uncertainties and developing realistic scenarios, especially for uncertain claims (e.g., those that could settle for nil or at policy limits) \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2022.pdf, pg 56, 57\].  
* **Documentation**: Justification and documentation of assumptions (especially critical ones), known limitations, and alternative methodologies considered are paramount for transparency and auditability \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2023.pdf, pg 89, 546; SP7.pdf, pg 546\].

In conclusion, case estimates are a fundamental building block of general insurance reserving, particularly for larger, more complex individual claims. While they offer the advantage of incorporating specific claim details and expert judgement, they are inherently subjective, time-consuming, and cannot address IBNR. Actuaries must be acutely aware of their limitations and potential distortions, using them judiciously alongside statistical methodologies, and ensuring clear communication of the underlying assumptions and uncertainties. This holistic approach, driven by robust actuarial judgement, is what truly defines best practice in reserving.
