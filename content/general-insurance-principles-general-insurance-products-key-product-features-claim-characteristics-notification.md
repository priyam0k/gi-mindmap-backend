As your Specialist Actuarial Note Builder and Exam Coach, let's construct a detailed note on the concept of **Notification**, placing it within the larger context of **Claim Characteristics**. Understanding the nuances of when a claim is reported is a fundamental aspect of general insurance, as it directly impacts reserving, the basis of cover, and the overall assessment of liability development for both SP7 and SP8.

### **The Larger Context: Claim Characteristics**

When we analyse any general insurance product, one of the six key features is its **Claim Characteristics** \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. This feature describes how claims originate, are reported, and settled, and it is a primary determinant of whether a product is short-tail or long-tail \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The **notification** of a claim is the first formal step in this process from the insurer's perspective; it marks the point at which an incident becomes a known potential liability \[SP7.pdf, SP8.pdf\].

### **1\. Defining Notification and Reporting Delays**

The **notification date** is the date when a claim is first reported to the insurer \[SP752.pdf\]. The time lag between the claim event occurring and the notification date is known as the **reporting delay** \[SP752.pdf\].

* **Short-tail Business**: For products like motor or household property, notification is typically prompt, and reporting delays are short. An event like a car accident is usually reported to the insurer quickly \[SP752.pdf\].  
* **Long-tail Business**: For liability classes, reporting delays can be considerable \[SP752.pdf\]. The sources highlight that for some industrial diseases like asbestosis, the delay between the exposure (the event) and the notification of a claim can span several decades \[SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

The length of this reporting delay is a critical characteristic that influences the entire financial management of a product.

### **2\. The Critical Role of Notification in Determining the Basis of Cover**

The date of notification is the key trigger that distinguishes between the two main bases of cover, which is a crucial product feature for any liability class:

* **Losses-Occurring Basis**: Here, the policy responds to losses that *occur* during the policy period, regardless of when the claim is notified. The notification date is less critical for determining which policy year is liable, but the *delay* until notification is a major source of **Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR)** risk for the insurer \[SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].  
* **Claims-Made Basis**: Here, the policy responds to claims that are *notified* or *reported* to the insurer during the policy period, irrespective of when the loss occurred \[SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\]. For these products, the notification date is the paramount trigger that determines whether a policy provides cover \[SP752.pdf\]. This basis was developed partly to manage the risk associated with very long reporting delays under losses-occurring policies \[SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf, SP7.pdf\].

### **3\. Procedural Aspects of Notification**

The process of notification itself has procedural nuances that actuaries must understand, as they can distort the data used for pricing and reserving.

* **Point of Notification**: Insurers must have clear and consistent rules governing when a notified incident is formally set up as a claim record on their systems \[SP752.pdf, SP8.pdf\]. The sources note that this could be at various points, such as when a claim form is requested, when it is returned, or when a claims manager formally accepts it \[SP752.pdf\]. Changes to these internal procedures can significantly affect the recorded numbers of claims and the apparent speed of notification \[SP752.pdf\].

* **Online Notification**: The advent of new technology, such as online claims reporting portals, can affect policyholder notification patterns. Such tools may increase the propensity to notify the insurer of an incident, potentially leading to an increase in the number of recorded **nil claims** if the policyholder doesn't proceed after notification (e.g., after realising the loss is below their excess) \[SP7 CMP Upgrade 2024.pdf\].

* **Reinsurance Notification**: For reinsurance, particularly excess of loss covers, notification delays from the cedant to the reinsurer can create an additional layer of IBNR. It is common for treaties to require the cedant to notify the reinsurer of all claims that are expected to exceed a certain percentage (e.g., half) of the retention level, in an attempt to reduce this delay \[SP8.pdf\].

### **4\. Notification and its Impact on Reserving and Pricing**

The analysis of notification patterns is a core actuarial investigation.

* **Grouping Data by Origin (Claim Cohorts)**: For reserving and experience analysis, claims data is often grouped into cohorts. The choice of cohort is directly linked to the concept of notification \[SP752.pdf\].

  * **Accident Year**: Groups claims by when the event occurred. The delay until notification creates the IBNR liability that must be estimated.  
  * **Reporting Year**: Groups claims by when they were **notified** to the insurer. A key feature of this cohort is that it does not, by definition, allow for pure IBNR, as no more claims can be added after the end of the reporting period \[SP752.pdf\].  
  * **Underwriting Year**: Groups claims by the policy inception date. Here, delays in notification for long-tail classes mean the ultimate cost for an underwriting year can remain uncertain for a very long time \[SP752.pdf\].  
* **Large Claims**: For large liability claims, notification is a key milestone. However, it can take a long time after the initial notification for the claim to be recognised as being very large, as information about the full extent of the injury or damage emerges \[SP752.pdf\]. This delay between notification and recognition of severity is a source of IBNER (Incurred But Not Enough Reported) risk.

In summary, **notification** is a cornerstone of a product's claim characteristics. The timing and procedures surrounding it are pivotal in defining the basis of cover, managing long-tail risk, and structuring the data used for all major actuarial investigations in pricing and reserving.
